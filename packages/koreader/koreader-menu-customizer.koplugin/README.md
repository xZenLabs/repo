## "Where did all the buttons go?" — You, hopefully.

KOReader is amazing. Its menus? They have more buttons than a spaceship cockpit. 
This plugin lets you hide the clutter so you can actually, *read*.

## What can it do?
*   **Hide the Useless Stuff**: Toggle off menus you never touch. (It hides them; it doesn't delete them. I'm not a monster.)
*   **Profiles**: Create setups like "Deep Reading," "Night Mode," or "I Am Overwhelmed."
*   **One-Click Sync**: Too lazy to configure the Reader menu after fixing the File Manager? Me too. Hit "Apply File Manager Layout to Reader" and be done with it.
*   **Safety First**: I locked the critical stuff (Search, Settings, etc.) so you can't accidentally brick your experience and blame me.

## How to Install
1.  Grab the ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/JoeBumm/menu_customizer.koplugin/releases/).
2.  Unzip it. You want the `menu_disabler.koplugin` folder.
3.  Throw that folder into your KOReader plugins directory (`koreader/plugins/`).
4.  Restart KOReader.

## How to Use
1.  Go to **More tools → Menu Disabler**.
2.  Pick a mode (File Manager or Reader).
3.  **Tap to hide/show items.** X means visible. [] means "gone to the shadow realm."
4.  **HIT SAVE.** If you don't save, it didn't happen. 

## Help! I Broke It!
If you somehow managed to hide the "Un-hide" button or your device is acting possessed:
*   **Try First** deleting the `filemanager_menu_order.lua` and `reader_menu_order.lua` from your `koreader/settings/` folder.
*   **If it didn't work delete the plugin folder `menu_disabler.koplugin`. KOReader will forgive you.
