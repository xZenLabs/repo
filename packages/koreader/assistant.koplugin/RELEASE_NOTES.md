# v1.18

#### Highlights
More places inside KOReader where AI is one tap away:
- File Manager long-press: Book Info (AI) and Recap (AI)
- Book Description Translate
- Smarter AI Dictionary with configurable output
- Notebook and result viewers with a consistent reading experience

#### What's New

**More KOReader Entry Points**
- **File Manager long-press** — run Book Info (AI) and Recap (AI) without opening the book.
- **Book Description Translate** — translate the book blurb directly from the description popup.
- **Smarter Translate routing** — short selections ask once (Translate / Dictionary / Cancel) and remember your choice; long selections always translate.

**AI Dictionary, Less Clutter**
- Output sections are now configurable with Concise / Standard / Full presets, defaulting to a shorter Standard set. Concise mode additionally favors brevity over book-awareness.

**Result Viewer and Notebook Viewer**
- **Result viewer (ChatGPTViewer)** — two-row buttons with paging Find, plus Vocabulary Builder and Annotate actions.
- **Notebook viewer** — notebooks open in a TextViewer-based Markdown viewer with table support.
- Both viewers now share the same CSS, so AI answers and saved notes read the same.

**AI Notes (formerly General Notebooks)**
- Renamed to **AI Notes** to distinguish them from KOReader's built-in reading notes.
- By default a single conversation log (`ai_notes.md`): AI answers and quick notes are appended to it, with optional auto-save per conversation.
- **Multiple AI Notes** — enable it in AI Notes Settings to create several notes and choose which one is active.
- Book notes save to per-book files (`<AI Notes folder>/<book>.md`) inside your AI Notes folder, which is configurable in Settings and auto-created on write.

**Provider & Model Polish**
- Model picker and provider forms are testable in place, with explicit confirmation and clearer failure reports.
- API errors surface the provider's own message with HTTP status; connection-test output no longer leaks request bodies.

#### Improvements & Fixes
- Highlight menu: stale menus close after add/remove, selection stays alive for Annotate.
- Anthropic models support built-in web search.
- Reasoning (model thinking) renders dimmed above the answer and only when enabled.
- Streaming title shows the request origin; provider/model identity is frozen per request.
- Dictionary popup entries moved into Dictionary Settings; KOReader Tweaks renamed to Other Settings.

#### Translations
All languages refreshed with the new dictionary, viewer, and notebook strings.

# v1.17

> 📦 **Android users:** this release repairs the accelerated text renderer that was silently broken on Android — AI answers and dictionary results will render noticeably faster after updating.

#### Highlights
Do more from the screen: tune your AI providers, test them, and update the plugin — without opening a configuration file.

#### What's New

**Provider Setup, Now Fully On-Screen**
- **Reasoning Option** — dial back (or off) a model's "thinking" in one tap. The dialog shows only the choices your selected provider understands, applies immediately, and never touches your config file.
- **Test Connection** — probe a new provider right from the add/edit form; tells you instantly if the address, key, or model name is wrong, with the provider's own explanation (your key is never shown).
- **Cleaner provider management** — Add moved to the presets menu, Delete now lives inside Edit with a confirmation, simplified button row.
- **Better model picker** — title names the provider, "Manual" renamed to **Custom**, explicit **OK** to confirm.

**OTA Updates You Can Trust**
- The update dialog now pre-fills the right target for you: stable installs upgrade to the latest stable release by default, development installs stay on the bleeding edge — unless you explicitly type a different branch or tag to switch.
- New releases are checked quietly in the background (at most once per 48 hours) with a toast when one is out.
- Failed downloads are reported persistently instead of flashing by, Android installs are far more robust, and only the files the plugin actually needs are installed.

#### Improvements & Fixes
- **Your Ask dialog choices stick** — Web Search and Copy-to-Clipboard now keep their state after a restart instead of resetting.
- **Consistent dialog buttons** — confirm buttons are now uniformly **OK** across all dialogs instead of a mix of Save/OK.
- **Errors in plain language** — see what the provider actually said ("invalid API key", "model not found") instead of a raw data blob.
- **Quicker recovery from rate limits** — retries now wait at most 5 seconds (was up to a minute) and show the reason.
- **Follow-up suggestions per prompt** — each prompt decides whether the model offers follow-up questions, instead of one global switch.
- **Simpler config template** — fresh setups are built around four clearly-labelled service types; existing configs unaffected.
- **Cleaner debug logs** — verbose request data trimmed, so logs attached to bug reports stay readable.

#### Translations
All languages refreshed with the new on-screen settings.

# v1.16

> ⚠️ **OTA Users: Please update twice — the first OTA loses translations, the second restores them.** Details below.

#### Highlights
Smarter context control, per-model tuning, and more resilient API handling.

#### What's New

**Context Management — New "Current Chapter Only" Option**
Context management in the Ask dialog now includes `Current Chapter Only`. When `Include Text Read So Far` is checked, you can limit context to the current chapter only (auto-detected via the book's Table of Contents). Great for focusing answers on the chapter you're reading. Hidden automatically if the book has no TOC. Thanks to @Vilhelm-Ian (#205).

**Per-Model Parameter Presets**
Configure separate `additional_parameters` (e.g. `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `reasoning`) for each model under the same provider via `model_parameters` in `configuration.lua`. Switching models via Settings → Browse Models applies the matching preset automatically; models without a preset keep the shared defaults. See `configuration.sample.lua` for examples. Thanks to @SUBHAM-ROY (#200).

**Automatic Retry on API 429 (Rate Limit)**
When the provider returns **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests** (rate limit / quota exceeded), the plugin now retries automatically — up to 8 times — respecting `Retry-After` headers, with exponential backoff and jitter. Works for both streaming and non-streaming requests. During streaming, a cancellable countdown `API Busy (429) — Attempts N/M` is shown.

#### Improvements & Fixes
- **Web Search compatibility** — Search tool renamed to `assistant_web_search` to avoid 400 errors on gateways (e.g. OneAPI) that filter the generic `web_search` name.
- **Dictionary accuracy** — Dictionary and Term X-Ray prompts now include book title/author and handle word forms better.
- **More robust streaming** — Ignore SSE `id:` fields to fix stray `id:0 id:1...` text with Qwen and other OpenAI-compatible models.
- **Settings dialog** — Browse Models failures no longer close the settings window.
- **Ask dialog polish** — Improved checkbox layout, separator, input height; reasoning blocks now wrap correctly.

#### Translations & Details
All 42+ languages updated. The plugin now reuses KOReader's native translation module directly instead of bundling a stale copy of `gettext` — only the adapter entry is customized — with translations shipped as compiled `.mo` files for faster loading. This format change is why OTA requires two passes; fresh installs via zip are not affected.

# v1.15

## v1.15 Release Notes

### Changes since v1.14

This is a usability-focused iteration around provider setup, web search, and prompt context.

#### Highlights

- **UI-managed Provider Keys — zero-config start** — After installing from the KOReader Plugin Store, you can configure everything directly in the UI. No `configuration.lua` editing required. Add, edit, and delete custom providers in Settings, with `display_name`, built-in presets, and per-handler **Browse Models** (fetches via the handler's own `FetchModels`). The plugin also starts cleanly with no file-based config at all.
- **Web search configuration UI** — Web search moves from config file to UI: manage multiple search APIs, long-press to edit/delete, and see configured state at a glance via menu icons. The Ask dialog now has a dedicated **Use web search** checkbox.
- **Notebook & context improvements** — Multiple general notebooks with a folder picker and dedicated settings submenu. Prompts can now optionally include **book metadata** and **nearby page text** as context, with related settings regrouped for clarity.
- **Settings & menu polish** — Reorganized menus, unified Title Case labels, dynamic navigation, and conditional display of Custom Prompts.

#### Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed ~20s delay before the Wi-Fi prompt on every AI action; consolidated `runWhenOnline` handling across 21 call sites.
- Fixed forwarding of the `thinking` parameter to OpenAI-compatible handlers, `null tool_calls` crashes, Gemini OpenAI-compat response tolerance, and OpenRouter model filtering via `/models/user`.
- Improved stream error handling (surface server messages), auto-scroll behavior, and Responses API `reasoning_summary` handling.
- Hardened `ai_translate.py` and `l10n/Makefile` (now fails on `.po` syntax errors).
- Added headless test framework and `wbuilder` UI preview tooling.

#### Thanks

Special thanks to contributors in this cycle:

- @SUBHAM-ROY — web search toggle for Ask, OpenRouter guardrail-aware model filtering
- @jdbway — Wi-Fi delay fix (#197)
- @anhnn2010 — multiple general notebooks (#192)
- @Craftwork2720 — `thinking` parameter forwarding (#188)

And everyone who helped with translations, feedback, and testing.

# v1.14

## v1.14 Release Notes

### Changes since v1.13

#### New Features
- **Bold dialog labels and status verbs via PTF** — Error dialogs, OTA update dialogs, and search info dialogs now use bold formatting for key labels, making them easier to scan at a glance.
- **Gemini 3 thinking budget auto-conversion** — The `thinking_budget` setting now automatically converts to Gemini 3's expected format. Disabled by default in the sample config.

#### Bug Fixes
- **Dictionary popup AI buttons** — AI buttons in the dictionary popup no longer disappear after customizing the dict button layout (#187).
- **Gemini thinking config** — Fixed `thinkingConfig` to use camelCase (required by Gemini API), and fixed a bug where `thinking_budget=0` was silently ignored instead of disabling thinking.
- **Server error messages** — Non-200 HTTP responses now surface the server's actual error message instead of a generic "fetchJSON: failed to parse" message.
- **Error dialog polish** — Error messages are now formatted with bold labels and clearer structure.
- **Silenced noise logs** — Unprocessed SSE event logs for `web_search_call` lifecycle events and Responses API annotation events are now suppressed.
- **OTA and search info dialogs** — Polished the layout and text of OTA update and search tool info dialogs.
- **PO file format** — Normalized `.po` file format to 1-space alignment, eliminating diff noise from `msgattrib -i` misuse.

#### Internal Improvements
- `assistant_utils` is now imported as `ASUtils` consistently across the codebase.
- String concatenation loops replaced with `string.buffer` / `table.concat` for better performance.
- OTA updater path construction routed through `FFIUtil.joinPath` for cross-platform safety.
- Gemini `thinking_budget` handling consolidated into a single handler.
- Bold formatting centralized through `bold_format` helper, keeping translatable strings contiguous.
- Removed unused shell translation script.
