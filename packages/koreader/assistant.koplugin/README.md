[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/omer-faruq/assistant.koplugin)

A powerful plugin that lets you interact with AI language models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama etc.) while reading. Ask questions about text, get translations, summaries, explanations and more - all without leaving your book.

<small>Originally forked from a deleted fork of AskGPT by zeeyado, then modified using WindSurf. That fork is now public and includes many updates: https://github.com/zeeyado/koassistant.koplugin </small>

## Features

- **Multiple AI Providers**: Speaks the mainstream protocols natively — OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages, and Google Gemini — so most platforms work out of the box. Examples:
  - OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama, Groq, Mistral, NVIDIA, etc. (via OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
  - Claude (Anthropic), Gemini, and the OpenAI Responses API
- **Stream Mode**: Real-time responses from the API. Get the full LLM experience on e-ink devices.
- **Multiple Providers/Models**: Select different models or AI provider platforms in the UI.
- **UI-Based Setup**: Add providers and models entirely from the UI, with built-in model browsing and connection testing.
- **Web Search**: Let LLMs search the web for real and up-to-date information. Supports SerpAPI, Tavily, Exa, and SearXNG, with a per-question toggle.
- **Built-in Prompts**:
  - **Translation**: Instantly translate highlighted text to any language
  - **Quick Actions**: One-click buttons for common tasks like summarizing or explaining
  - **Dictionary**: Get book-aware explanations — meaning, synonyms, and usage in the current book. (thanks to [plateaukao](https://github.com/plateaukao))
  - **Term X-Ray**: For single word or phrase highlights, get the meaning of it based on the previously mentioned places. (thanks to [Michael Kucek](https://github.com/michael-kucek))
  - **Recap**: Catch up on a book you haven't opened for a while. (thanks to [jbhul](https://github.com/jbhul))
  - **X-Ray**: A spoiler-free guide to characters, places, themes, and timeline up to your progress.
- **Markdown Support**: (thanks to [David Fan](https://github.com/d-fan))
- **Notebook & Quick Notes**: Save AI conversations and quick notes as Markdown, either to the current book or a general notebook, with optional auto-save.
- **Highlight Menu Presets**: Pin built-in prompts to the highlight popup for one-tap access (configurable).
- **Book Insights**: Explore the whole book without highlighting — Book Summary & Recs, AI X-Ray, AI Recaps, and analysis or summaries built from your highlights and notes.
- **Gesture Shortcuts**: Trigger Ask, Recap, and X-Ray by gesture, no highlighting needed. (thanks to [Jayphen](https://github.com/Jayphen))
- **AI Dictionary**: Get book-aware definitions and synonyms for any word or phrase, based on the book you are reading.
- **l10n Support**: Supports all languages that the KOReader project supports.

## Basic Requirements

- [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) installed on your device
- API key from a LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, etc.)
- (Optional) API key from a search api provider (Tavily, SerpAPI, SearXNG ...)

## Getting Started 

### 1. Get API Keys

See [Obtaining API Keys](../../wiki/Obtaining-API-Keys) from the wiki page.

### 2. Installation:

[Installation Guide](../../wiki/Installation)

### 3. Configure the Plugin

All setup can be done directly from the KOReader UI.

#### Option A: Configure from the UI

**Providers:**

1. Go to `⚙ → AI Assistant → Settings → Provider API` and choose a preset (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, DeepSeek, OpenRouter). For any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint, start from the `OpenAI` preset and update the URL.
2. Fill in the dialog:
   - **Provider Name** — the label shown in menus
   - **Base URL** — pre-filled by the preset, editable
   - **API Key** — your provider key
   - **Model** — type it manually, or tap **Browse Models** to fetch the list online and pick one
3. Tap **Test** to check the connection, then **OK** to save. The new provider becomes active right away.
4. To switch providers later, go to `⚙ → AI Assistant → Settings → Providers and Models` and select one. Only providers added from the UI can be edited or deleted.

**Web search keys (SerpAPI / Tavily / Exa / SearXNG):** available both via UI configuration (`Settings → WebSearch API`) and via the configuration file. In the Ask dialog, use the `🌐 Web Search` checkbox to enable it per question.

#### Option B (Advanced): Use `configuration.lua`

1. Copy `configuration.sample.lua` to `configuration.lua` (do not modify the sample file directly).
2. Edit the `configuration.lua` file as needed.
    - Set your API keys in `provider_settings`.
    - For more advanced configuration, see the Wiki Configuration.lua.

#### Using OpenAI-Compatible APIs

The plugin supports any OpenAI-compatible API through a flexible naming pattern. Configuration keys follow the format `{handler}_{description}`, where:
- **handler**: The API handler to use (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`)
- **description**: Any descriptive name for your configuration (e.g., `perplexity`, `grok`, `local`)

**Examples:**
- `openai_perplexity` → uses the `openai` handler for Perplexity API
- `openai_grok` → uses the `openai` handler for Grok API
- `anthropic_websearch` → uses the `anthropic` handler with web search enabled

You can create multiple configurations using the same handler with different settings. The part before the first underscore determines which handler is used.

In the UI, this is the same as picking the `OpenAI` preset and replacing the Base URL — use `Clear` to start from a blank URL if needed.

Here's the minimum working example:

```lua
local CONFIGURATION = {

    provider_settings = {
        gemini = {
            model = "gemini-2.5-flash",
            base_url = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/",
            api_key = "your-gemini-api-key",
        },
        -- You can add other providers here, for example:
        -- openai = {
        --     model = "gpt-4o-mini",
        --     base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
        --     api_key = "your-openai-api-key",
        -- }
    }
}
return CONFIGURATION
```

### 4. Using the Plugin

#### Standard Usage

1. Open any book in KOReader
2. Highlight the text you want to analyze
3. Tap the highlight and select "AI Assistant"
4. Choose an action:
   - **Ask**: Ask a specific question about the text
   - **Custom Actions**: Use any prompts you've configured
       - **Translate**: Convert text to your configured language
5. **Additional Questions**: Ask additional questions about the highlighted text using your custom prompts

#### Using AI Translate with Gestures

You can set up a long-press gesture to translate instantly, bypassing the highlight menu. This is done by overriding KOReader's built-in "Translate" action. (thanks to [Ilia Reutov](https://github.com/Agnesor))

1.  **Enable the Override**:
    *   Navigate to the top menu `Tools (🔧) > More tools`.
    *   Find and enable **Use AI Assistant for 'Translate'**.

2.  **Set the Gesture**:
    *   Go to KOReader's main menu -> `Taps and gestures` -> `Gesture manager`.
    *   Select `Long-press on text`.
    *   Choose **"Translate"** from the list of actions.

Now, when you long-press a word, the AI translates it directly. To use the standard translation service again, simply uncheck the override option in the Assistant plugin's menu.

#### Dictionary Output

Choose what the AI Dictionary returns under **Dictionary Settings**: Concise / Standard / Full presets, or toggle individual sections (meaning, synonyms, translation, word form, examples, origin).

#### Dictionary Popup Buttons

The Assistant plugin adds AI-powered buttons (Wikipedia, Term X-Ray, Dictionary, and custom prompts) to the dictionary popup when you look up words.

**Note**: In newer KOReader versions (2026.05+), dictionary popup buttons can be customized via **Dictionary settings → Customize buttons → Max buttons in row**. Increase this value to display multiple plugin buttons on the same row.

### Tips

- Use **Long-tap** (tap & hold for 3+ secs) on a single word to pop up the highlight menu
- **Long press** :
  - On the "AI Assistant" main button to see the **settings** and **reset** buttons
  - On a prompt button to **add** it to the main highlight menu.
  - On a button in the main highlight menu to **remove** it.
  - On the close button in the result window to instantly **close all dialogs** and return directly to your reading experience
- Use the **Select** button on the highlight menu to use text from multiple pages
- Draw a multiswipe to **CLOSE** the dialog (eg: swipe ⮠  or ⮡  or circle ↺)
- Keep highlights reasonably sized for best results
- Use **"Ask"** for specific questions about the text
- Try the pre-made buttons for quick analysis
- Add your own custom prompts for specialized tasks
- **Entering API keys on e-ink**: save the key in a `.txt` file, send it to your reader, open it as a book, copy the key, then long-press the API Key field and paste.
- **Entering very long URLs**: save the provider with a short placeholder URL first, then reopen it with **Edit** and replace it with the full URL.
