# v6.5.2

### Fixed
- In the previous release missed to raise to _meta.lua version. Nothing else changed. #78

# v6.5.1

### Added
- "Show week numbers" option (off by default, in Advanced settings > Date & time): adds a gray week-number column to both reading calendars. #77

# v6.5.0

### New
- Added a hamburger menu to the top-left of the Reading Insights popup's title bar, giving quick access to the Streak, Heatmap, Records, and Achievements popups without navigating the full page.
  - Added an Advanced settings toggle (Reading insight popup → "Hamburger menu") to show/hide it. Default: off.
- French translation added #75 (Thanks @maxxfly) and added some missing translations for other languages.

# v6.4.1

### Changed
- Book progress → chapter bar: when a book has fewer chapters than the
  "Chapters per page" setting (default 25), the paging arrows no longer
  appear at all (previously shown greyed-out). Instead, the chapter
  columns stretch to use the freed-up width.

# v6.4.0

### Added
- Reading streak popup can now be assigned to a gesture/shortcut
  (Dispatcher action: "Reading insights: reading streak"). 
- Reading heatmap popup can now be opened directly, without going
  through the main insights popup first — via a new Tools menu entry
  ("Show Reading heatmap") and a new gesture/shortcut action
  ("Reading insights: reading heatmap").
- Translations for both new actions/menu entry in all supported
  languages (en, de, hu, pt_PT, uk, zh_CN).
