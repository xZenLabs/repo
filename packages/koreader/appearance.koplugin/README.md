## Usage

<summary><strong>Applying a Theme</strong></summary>

<br>

Navigate to **🞂 Appearance 🞂 Themes** and select any theme from the list. The UI updates instantly without needing to restart.
 
To go back to the default look, choose **🞂 Appearance 🞂 Themes 🞂 Reset themes 🞂 Reset to default themes**. This clears all theme overrides and restores KOReader's original colors.

<summary><strong>Adding/Configuring Themes</strong></summary>

<br>

Themes can be added by pressing **🞂 Appearance 🞂 Themes 🞂 Add a theme**, from there you can choose the background and foreground colors for the theme.

Themes can be configured by holding down on them when selecting them from the list. Then, an option menu will show that gives you the ability to rename, change the colors of, and delete the theme.

<summary><strong>Setting a Background Image</strong></summary>

You can select where you want the background image to be shown, such as in the file browser, reader, the top menu, and SimpleUI homescreen.
 
To remove it, return to the same menu and hold down on the currently selected image.

A background image can also be automatically set/changed by using the "Select background image" action in profiles. This allows you to set one of the past background images automatically or by gestures.

## Compatibility
Tested fully on e-ink, desktop, and mobile devices. Fully compatible with popular plugins like [Rakuyomi](https://github.com/tachibana-shin/rakuyomi) and [SimpleUI](https://github.com/doctorhetfield-cmd/simpleui.koplugin).

PDF background color customization is compatible with the dual pages feature introduced by [ComicReader](https://github.com/KORComic/comicreader.koplugin) by [@OGKevin](https://github.com/OGKevin).

For rounded book & folder covers to work properly with the background color, [my special rounded cover patches](https://github.com/Euphoriyy/KOReader.patches#-2-rounded-coverslua) should be used.
