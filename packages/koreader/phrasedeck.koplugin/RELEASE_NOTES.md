5. **Context words = 0 support**

6. **Minimum interval setting for spaced repetition**
   - New "Minimum interval (days)" setting with options: Default, 1d, 3d, 7d, 14d
   - Applies to Again button (smallest interval) with proportional scaling:
     * Again: min_interval
     * Hard: min_interval × 1.5
     * Good: min_interval × 2
     * Easy: min_interval × 4
   - Enforces minimum floor on all review card intervals
   - Scales initial intervals for new cards proportionally
