# v1.2.0

Suwayomi Client v1.2.0 adds saved Library and chapter lists for offline browsing, opens Library directly, and strengthens download and reading-state safety when connections change or saves fail.

## Highlights

### Browse and read offline

- Library and chapter lists save automatically as you browse. Saved lists appear immediately while the server refreshes; downloaded chapters open without waiting for the server.
- Keep browsing saved lists when the server is unavailable, without repeated background connection-error popups. Explicit **Refresh** and **Refresh chapters** still report failures, as do failed saves.
- Resume downloaded chapters with KOReader's saved reading progress and use **Go to Suwayomi** to return to their chapter list offline.
- Complete server results replace saved lists, including removed manga or chapters and empty results, without deleting downloaded files or reading progress.

### Reach Library faster

**Search > Suwayomi** now opens Library using your category-picker preference. The title-bar menu offers **Library** and **Suwayomi home**; Home keeps **Browse**, **Downloads**, **Sync**, and **Settings** available. Back from the Library root exits the plugin.

### Clearer download controls

Use **Download next** for a one-time batch or **Auto-download** to keep the first unread chapters available. **Delete after reading** and **Delete when marked read** name the separate cleanup settings. Download help explains their completion rules and limits. These controls affect device-local CBZ files.

## Reliability fixes

- Keep queued downloads, retries, and redownloads tied to their recorded server. Changing the connection cannot silently fetch a same-ID chapter from another server. Restore the original connection before retrying affected jobs.
- Keep pending read/unread changes tied to their verified server and preserve saved choices when a refresh or read-state save fails.
- Display successfully refreshed chapter lists even when later reconciliation cannot be saved. Report the storage error and preserve local archives and confirmed reading state.
- Preserve reading progress for local files whose server association is not yet verified, and repair offline chapter actions and unread shortcuts.

## Updating

### KOReader App Store

If you use the [KOReader App Store plugin](https://github.com/omer-faruq/appstore.koplugin), open **Tools > App Store**, select **Check plugin updates**, and run **Check all updates**. Select `suwayomi.koplugin`, update it, then restart KOReader.

### Manual update

1. Download **`suwayomi.koplugin-v1.2.0.zip`** from the assets below, not GitHub's source archives.
2. Quit KOReader normally. Replace the existing plugin folder under `koreader/plugins/`, then relaunch. Keep your KOReader settings and downloaded chapters.

After either update route, open **Search > Suwayomi** while connected and browse the manga you want available offline. Library and chapter lists build through normal browsing; this does not download chapter contents automatically.

If a chapter list has never been loaded, it may have no saved information. Recorded downloads can supply fallback rows. Recovered files with no known server connection offer **Open** and **Verify download**; server sync, downloading, and deletion remain unavailable for those rows.

If an older queued job reports an unknown server origin, **Retry** cannot resume it. Use **Downloads > Clear failed**, reopen the manga on the intended server, and queue the chapter again. **Clear failed** removes failed jobs in bulk and keeps records linked to local archives.

# v1.1.1

Suwayomi Client v1.1.1 fixes a regression in v1.1.0 that prevented Basic Auth connections over HTTPS, including connections that were already configured.

## Fixed

- Fix **“Could not reach the Suwayomi server: redirect not supported”** when using Basic Auth over HTTPS. The plugin passed an unsupported option to KOReader's HTTPS client, which rejected the request before contacting the server. This error did not mean the server was redirecting the connection.
- Restore HTTPS requests for connection tests, library access, covers, chapter pages, and chapter archive downloads. Simple Login and UI Login retain their existing redirect restrictions.

## Verification improvements

- Add a regression test that exercises the real LuaSec request-option validation for Basic Auth queries, images, and archives.
- Add an optional HTTPS sandbox with a private localhost certificate and authenticated readiness checks. The repaired Basic Auth workflow was verified in real KOReader, including rejected credentials, successful connection, chapter download, opening, and return navigation. The fix was also confirmed on an Android device with existing Basic Auth settings.

## Updating

1. Download **`suwayomi.koplugin-v1.1.1.zip`** from the assets below, not GitHub's source archives.
2. Quit KOReader normally. Replace the existing plugin under `koreader/plugins/`, then relaunch KOReader. Keep your KOReader settings and downloaded chapters.
3. Run **Settings > Connection > Test connection** in Suwayomi.

**Keep your existing HTTPS URL and Basic Auth credentials.** No server change, authentication-method change, or setup reset is needed. This hotfix does not change settings, downloads, or reading-state behavior.

# v1.1.0

Suwayomi Client v1.1.0 adds Simple Login and UI Login support, makes offline downloads more resilient, and improves how reading progress and local chapter cleanup work together.

## Highlights

### Connect with all three authentication methods

Choose **Basic Auth**, **Simple Login**, or **UI Login** in the setup wizard or connection settings to match your Suwayomi server. Simple Login and UI Login reconnect using your saved credentials; session cookies and JWT tokens stay in memory rather than being saved to disk. UI Login can refresh a rejected access token without interrupting your workflow.

### Keep your next chapters ready

**Download ahead** now saves refill work and recovers it after a KOReader restart. Finishing a chapter and closing it, or manually marking chapters as read, can refill your reading buffer even when the chapter list is not open. The menu shows the saved buffer size, with clearer refill status and Retry/Stop controls.

When you enable Download ahead, the plugin can offer KOReader's **Always mark as finished** setting. This is optional and applies to **all KOReader documents**, not only manga. Declining it leaves Download ahead enabled; manual read marking still works.

### More resilient background downloads

- Retry temporary network failures with bounded retries, and recover unfinished download jobs after restarting KOReader.
- Keep downloads running as you move between menus and the reader. Waiting retries and stopping workers no longer unnecessarily hold up other downloads.
- Show clearer failure details and preserve retry status. Use **Verify download** to check a suspect archive and **Redownload** to replace a damaged copy.
- Preserve completed-download bookkeeping when cancellation races with a finished transfer.

## Reading and library fixes

- Load complete chapter lists for large series, rather than making bulk actions depend on an incomplete list. Download actions disclose their limit of **50 new chapters per action**.
- Follow KOReader's finished status for automatic read completion. Reaching the last page alone no longer marks a chapter as read.
- Preserve KOReader reading metadata, including backup-only metadata, when changing read state or removing a local archive after manual read marking.
- Make finished-chapter cleanup durable across restarts and retry failed removals. Protect open or replaced archives, and revoke pending manual removal when the server marks a chapter unread again.
- Save plugin state atomically and report failed writes instead of silently losing queue or reading changes.
- Fix stale chapter actions, submenu Back navigation, saved scanlator-filter recovery, and oversized status dialogs. Reduce routine notification popups.

## Translations

Russian, Ukrainian, and Simplified Chinese now cover all current plugin strings. Download controls, refill status, and automatic-finish prompts have clearer localized text.

## Updating and getting started

1. Download **`suwayomi.koplugin-v1.1.0.zip`** from the assets below. Use this plugin ZIP, not GitHub's automatically generated source archives.
2. Replace the existing `suwayomi.koplugin` folder under `koreader/plugins/`, then restart KOReader. Keep your KOReader settings and downloaded chapters.
3. Open **Search > Suwayomi**. If needed, select your server's authentication method under **Settings > Connection > Login information**, then run **Test connection**.

Existing Basic Auth connections do not need to switch methods. If a download fails because of authentication, correct the saved credentials and retry the download explicitly.

**Security:** Use HTTPS when connecting over a network. HTTP exposes credentials and session tokens. Changing saved credentials does not cancel downloads that are already running.

**Download scope:** All plugin downloads and removal policies affect device-local CBZ files. The plugin does not queue or delete server downloads. For faster transfers, predownload chapters through Suwayomi's WebUI; the plugin can copy a complete server archive instead of fetching each page separately.
