# v0.0.9

## v0.0.9

### Fixed

* Fixed an intermittent fatal KOReader crash while scanning the Kindle library from `cc.db`.
* The crash appeared as `PANIC: unprotected error in call to Lua API (bad callback)` and could occur only on some launches depending on LuaJIT state.
* Fixed the underlying SQLite/FFI callback path by preventing `sqlite3_step()` from being JIT-compiled before SQLite invokes the plugin's ICU collation callback.
* The failure was reproduced deterministically on-device and the fix was verified against the same forced repro.

Thanks to @DerHerzog7 for the detailed report in #18.

# v0.0.8

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/kaikozlov/kindle.koplugin/compare/v0.0.5...v0.0.8

This release mostly focuses on reading position sync and support for newer Kindle firmware.

Reading position sync is now much more faithful to the native Kindle state. Automatic KOReader -> Kindle sync now runs when a book closes, supports exact kfx/pdoc positions, targets the correct downloaded book entry for catalog updates, and no longer stomps on Kindle's separate read/unread state. The catalog integration was also reworked to use Kindle's real locale/collation behavior while remaining self-contained and working in no framework mode.

Newer Java 21-based Kindle firmware is now supported by the integrated extraction path, and the native extractor fallback has a more reliable runtime environment. The Kindle library menu is also available while reading, unsafe maintenance actions are gated while a book is open, and there's now a dispatcher action for opening the Kindle library.

still very much a work in progress.

python remains slow

# v0.0.5

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/kaikozlov/kindle.koplugin/compare/v0.0.4...v0.0.5

major rewrite of the library and reading position sync

the plugin now integrates with koreader using normal file paths instead of the old virtual filesystem hacks. reading position sync is now exact where supported, book access is fully just-in-time, covers work properly in the kindle library, and there are a bunch of fixes for older kindle firmware, cold starts, drm fallback, cache handling, and sidecars.

also updated the bundled kfx converter and did a pretty significant cleanup of the old implementation.

still very much a work in progress, but this should be substantially more reliable than v0.0.4.

python remains slow
