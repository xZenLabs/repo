## Install

1. Download the latest `notebook.koplugin-<version>.zip` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/pierspad/notebook.koplugin/releases/latest).
2. Extract `notebook.koplugin` into KOReader's plugin directory:
   - Kindle: `/mnt/us/koreader/plugins/`
   - Kobo: `/.adds/koreader/plugins/`
3. Restart KOReader, then open **Tools → More tools → Notebook**.

Notebooks are stored in `koreader/notebook/`.

### Input debug log

To capture a device-specific pen problem, create a new notebook named `_debug_`
in the Notebook gallery (or create an empty file named `_debug_` inside `koreader/notebook/`).
Then open the `_debug_` notebook, reproduce the problem, and send
`koreader/notebook/notebook-debug.log` with your device model and firmware version.
The log records raw and screen coordinates, selected tools, touch events, and
rotation, plus the stylus button and physical tool flags; it does not contain
notebook pages or handwriting content. The log
rotates at about 1 MB: if `notebook-debug.log.1` exists, send that too. Together
the two files use at most about 2 MB. Delete the `_debug_` notebook (or `_debug_`
marker file) and reopen Notebook to stop logging. You can then delete both log files.

## Dispositivi

### Testati

- Amazon Kindle Scribe (1ª generazione)

### Da verificare

- Altri modelli Kindle Scribe
- Dispositivi KOReader con penna/stilo

Notebook è un plugin di KOReader; la compatibilità non dipende dal launcher
(per esempio ZenUI o Simple UI). Le voci “da verificare” non sono ancora state
provate e non implicano supporto confermato.

> [!TIP]
> You can also place Notebook directly on KOReader's bottom navigation bar using [SimpleUI](https://github.com/doctorhetfield-cmd/simpleui.koplugin) (Custom quick actions → Plugin → Notebook, icon `F405`).

## Features

- Fineliner, pressure-sensitive fountain pen and pencil, with a color palette.
- Highlighter; whole-stroke and partial-stroke erasers.
- A configurable pen button: use it for the highlighter or the eraser.
- Experimental 2× writing view on ordinary notebook pages: tap `2×` in the
  toolbar, drag with a finger to move around, and tap `1×` to return. Pen,
  highlighter and eraser work in this view; selecting another tool returns to
  the normal view. Imported PDF backgrounds and larger virtual page sizes are
  not yet supported by this first zoom trial.
- Palm rejection and direct stylus input.
- Explicit triangles, rectangles, squares and circles. Hold the pen or marker
  still at the end of a stroke to straighten a line or regularise a shape.
  In the notebook's gear menu, **Hold to straighten** turns this on or off;
  **Straight stroke** chooses a line or an arrow. It is enabled by default.
- Lasso selection with move, cut, copy, paste and delete.
- Editable text, multiple pages and per-page paper templates.
- PDF and Xournal++ export; optional LocalSend integration.

Colored pens and pencil use a dark live preview; the highlighter uses a light
black hatch so text remains readable. After roughly 0.8 seconds of inactivity,
the selected color is refreshed (plus the panel’s own update time).
This keeps slow grayscale/color refreshes out of the moving pen's path. Saved
notes and exports always retain the selected color and brush.

Hold or double-tap a tool button to open its options. Text options include a
10–96 pt size selector with −/+ buttons and a live typography sample. After cutting or copying,
use the Paste button in the top bar.

### Custom pen icons

KOReader looks in its user `icons` directory before bundled icons. On Kindle,
place your SVGs in `/mnt/us/koreader/icons/` with these exact names:
`notebook.pen.svg` (toolbar), `notebook.fineliner.svg` (Fineliner option), and
`notebook.pencil.svg` (Pencil option). The current fountain pen icon is
`notebook.fountain.svg` if you ever want to replace it too. Use a square
`viewBox="0 0 24 24"`, then restart KOReader so its icon cache sees the files.
These files stay outside the plugin directory when the plugin is updated.

The KOReader desktop emulator can check the color palette and grayscale
fallback, but its display is monochrome. To confirm actual color rendering,
test on a color e-ink device.

## Development

Requires LuaJIT, `luacheck` and gettext (`msgfmt`). For in-depth architectural and engineering documentation, see the [Technical Reference Manual](docs/README.md).

```bash
make verify       # lint and tests
make ci           # verification plus package checks
make package      # build the installable zip in build/
```

Tests run in separate LuaJIT processes across the available CPU cores. Set
`TEST_JOBS=4 make test` to limit concurrency.

For device deployment, copy `kindle.env.example` to `kindle.env`, configure the
device, then run `make deploy`. See `tools/deploy.sh --help` for options.
