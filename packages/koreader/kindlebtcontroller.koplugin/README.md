### Installation

#### Supported Devices

This plugin has been tested and verified on the following Kindle models:

| Device | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Kindle 2024** | ✅ Verified |
| **Kindle Paperwhite 11 (KPW5)** | ✅ Verified |
| **Kindle Paperwhite 12 (KPW6)** | ✅ Verified |

> 📝 Newer Kindle models with Bluetooth support should theoretically work as well.
>
> ⚠️ **Warning**: Older Kindle models than those listed above, such as Kindle Oasis 1 (KO) or Kindle Paperwhite 3 (KPW3), are **not supported** by this pairing method and are **not supported** by this plugin. Do **not** follow the Bluetooth pairing steps below on those devices, or the device may enter a white-screen state and require recovery.

#### Requirements

- **Software**: [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) installed on your Kindle
- **Controller**: Any Bluetooth HID gamepad or remote (Classic BR/EDR Bluetooth only, **BLE is NOT supported**)

#### Before You Install: Prepare Bluetooth Pairing

> ⚠️ **Important**: Kindle's native system does not support connecting non-audio Bluetooth devices. Special configuration is required to connect Bluetooth keyboards or game controllers.
>
> ⚠️ **Device safety warning**: Do not use the following pairing steps on unsupported older Kindle models, including KO and KPW3. These steps are only intended for the tested models above and newer compatible models. Using them on unsupported devices may cause a white screen and require manual recovery.

Before installing this plugin, you must first pair your Kindle with a Bluetooth controller. By default, the Kindle system does not allow pairing with non-audio Bluetooth devices, so the setup must be completed from the command line.

##### 1. Update the Bluetooth Detection Rules

```shell
# After connecting over SSH, switch the system partition to read-write mode.
mntroot rw
mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && cd /usr/local/bin
```

Open the file for editing:

```shell
vi /usr/local/bin/dev_is_keyboard.sh
```

Then paste in the following contents:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
DEVICE=$1
if evtest info $DEVICE | grep -q 'Event type 1 (Key)'; then
  if evtest info $DEVICE | grep -q 'Event code 16 (Q)'; then
    # Don't set these just because Key is supported -- that will
    # detect the touchscreen as a keyboard which breaks the UI
    echo ID_INPUT=1
    echo ID_INPUT_KEY=1
    echo ID_INPUT_KEYBOARD=1
  fi
fi
```

Then save the file and make it executable:

```shell
chmod +x dev_is_keyboard.sh
```

Open the rule file for editing:

```shell
vi /etc/udev/rules.d/99-bt-keyboard.rules
```

Then paste in the following contents:

```sh
KERNEL=="uhid", MODE="0660", GROUP="bluetooth"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="input", IMPORT+="/usr/local/bin/dev_is_keyboard.sh %N"
```

Then reload the udev rules:

```shell
cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger
```

##### 2. Pair the Bluetooth Device

Run `ace_bt_cli` to open the Bluetooth toolbox. Then run `radiostate` to check whether Bluetooth is enabled:

- If the output is `ACEBTCLI getRadioState() state:1 status:0`, Bluetooth is already enabled and you can start pairing.
- If the output is `ACEBTCLI getRadioState() state:0 status:0`, run `enable` first.

Use `pair {bt_addr}` to pair the device. BLE devices are not supported:

After pressing `Enter`, run `connectedlist` to confirm that the pairing entry appears in the list:

Open another terminal session and run `ls /dev/input/` to locate the Bluetooth input device path. In most cases, it is the last `eventX` device. Then run `evtest {dev_path}` and press buttons on the controller to confirm that input events are reported correctly.

##### 3. Disable Excess Logging

When a non-audio Bluetooth device disconnects, the system may generate a large number of unnecessary log files on disk. To prevent this, create the following marker files:

```shell
cd /mnt/us/ && touch DISABLE_CORE_DUMP && touch DISABLE_CORE_DUMP_ALERT
```

Then invert the CoreDump flag in `/usr/bin/dmcc.sh` by removing the `!` after the first `if` condition:

```shell
vi /usr/bin/dmcc.sh
```

### Install the Plugin

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/qiuyukang/kindlebtcontroller.koplugin/releases)
2. Extract and copy the `kindlebtcontroller.koplugin` directory to KOReader's plugin directory:

```bash
cp -r kindlebtcontroller.koplugin /mnt/us/koreader/plugins/
```

3. Restart KOReader

### Configuration

#### Default Config (`config.lua`)

The default configuration ships with mappings for a typical Bluetooth gamepad:

```lua
return {
    device_path = "/dev/input/event2",

    key_map = {
        [304] = "next_page",    -- BTN_A
        [305] = "next_page",    -- BTN_B
        [306] = "prev_page",    -- BTN_C
        [307] = "prev_page",    -- BTN_X
        -- ... more mappings
    },

    joy_map = {
        [16] = {                -- D-Pad horizontal
            [-1] = "decrease_brightness",
            [1] = "increase_brightness",
        },
        [17] = {                -- D-Pad vertical
            [-1] = "decrease_warmth",
            [1] = "increase_warmth",
        },
    },
}
```

#### Finding Your Device Path (Advanced / Troubleshooting)

The sample default path is `/dev/input/event2`. In most cases, you no longer need to change this path manually; it is only useful when troubleshooting.

After your Bluetooth controller is connected, run:

```bash
ls /dev/input
```

You will see multiple `eventX` files (where X is a number). The Bluetooth controller is **usually the one with the highest number** — it is the most recently added input device.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Do NOT configure the wrong event path! Other `eventX` files belong to the touchscreen, buttons, or other system devices. Configuring the wrong path may cause unexpected behavior (e.g., intercepting touchscreen or power button events). If unsure, try disconnecting the Bluetooth controller and running `ls /dev/input` again — the event file that disappears is the one belonging to your controller.

#### Customizing Mappings

You have two options:

1. **Via UI** — Use the "Key Config" menu in KOReader to view, add, edit, or delete mappings. Changes are saved to `settings/kindlebtcontroller.lua` and persist across restarts.

2. **Via config file** — Edit `config.lua` directly for default mappings. User changes made through the UI are stored separately and override defaults.

### Usage

After installation, find "Bluetooth Controller" in the KOReader menu under Tools.

#### Menu Options

- **Bluetooth Toggle** — Toggle Bluetooth on/off
- **Current Device** — Shows the device currently used to control Kindle
- **Paired Bluetooth Devices** — Shows paired devices and device details
- **Reload Device** — Manually reload the Bluetooth input device
- **Key Tester** — Enter key detection mode to identify button codes
- **Key Config** — View and edit all key mappings

#### Key Detection Mode

1. Open "Key Tester" from the menu
2. Press buttons on your controller — each press shows the key name, code, and current mapping
3. Tap any detected key to add or edit its mapping directly
4. Tap "Exit Tester" to exit

#### Gesture Bindings

The following actions are available in KOReader's gesture settings (under "Device"):

- Toggle Bluetooth
- Reload Bluetooth Device
- Key Tester
- Key Config

```

### How It Works

The plugin registers an input event hook via KOReader's `Device.input:registerEventAdjustHook()`. When a Bluetooth controller sends `EV_KEY` (button) or `EV_ABS` (joystick) events, the hook intercepts them, looks up the configured mapping, and dispatches the corresponding KOReader action.

A background watcher polls for device reconnection every 2 seconds. When a previously disconnected device reappears, it automatically reloads the input device and shows a notification.

### Troubleshooting

- **Controller not detected**: Make sure the Bluetooth device is connected. For troubleshooting, use `ls /dev/input` to check whether a new `eventX` device appears.
- **Buttons not working**: Use "Key Tester" to verify button codes, then check mappings in "Key Config".
- **Bluetooth won't turn on**: Ensure your Kindle model supports Bluetooth. Try toggling from Kindle's native settings first.
- **Debug logs**: Search for `BT Plugin` in KOReader's `crash.log` for detailed event logs.

### Localization

The plugin's default language is Chinese. When KOReader's UI language is set to English or another translated language, the plugin interface automatically switches to that language.

Currently supported languages:
- 🇨🇳 Chinese (default)
- 🇬🇧 English

Contributions for other languages are welcome! Simply create a language folder under `l10n/` (e.g., `ja`, `ko`) and add a `kindlebtcontroller.po` translation file.
