# v1.5.0 · 2026-09-10

- Add bidirectional reading progress sync.  Thanks to @emes81

# v1.4.0 · 2026-08-25

- show popup on bulk download process
- name downloads after the article title, without the bookmark id 
- add author, excerpt, cover and chapters to downloaded articles

# v1.3.3 · 2026-07-20

- fix: don't crash on non-http(s) image URLs
  Articles can contain `<img src="file://...">` or other non-web schemes
  (leftover from broken exports); socket.http has no handler for these
  and throws uncaught, crashing the reader. Reject unsupported schemes
  in resolveUrl and wrap http.request in pcall as a backstop.

# v1.3.2 · 2026-06-06

- fill author field for HTML and epub output file

# v1.3.1 · 2026-05-10
