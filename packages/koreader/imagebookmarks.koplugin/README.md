### Viewing bookmarked images

To view saved bookmarks, you need to first assign a gesture to the "Open image bookmark viewer" action:
  1. Top menu / <img src="./images/gear.svg" style="height: 1em;"> / Taps and gestures / Gesture manager / [ your preferred gesture ]
  2. Select "Open image bookmark viewer" under "General"

In the viewer:
- **Side tap:** Cycle bookmarks
- **Center tap:** Close viewer
- **Pinch and spread:** Zoom
- **Swipe:** Pan
- **Long press:** Open context menu

In the context menu, you can zoom and rotate, as well as remove and reorder your bookmarks.

### Adding external images

It is also possible to add external images as bookmarks. This can be useful e.g. when a higher-resolution map is available
on the internet than the one included with the book. To bookmark an external image, just place it in the
book's sidecar directory (by default: `<book-title>.sdr` located alongside the book). When opening the book, the image
should show up in the image bookmark viewer.

## Configuration

The plugin settings are available under: Top menu / <img src="./images/top_tools.svg" style="height: 1em;"> / Image bookmarks.

By default, the plugin remembers the rotation, zoom & pan of your bookmarks, here you can disable this if you wish.

If your device has physical buttons, you can also set their behavior.
