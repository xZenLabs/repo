# SimpleUI Extra Modules

Extra homescreen modules and patches for SimpleUI on KOReader.

**Modules** are **auto-discovered**: drop any `module_*.lua` file into the `modules/` folder and it will be picked up automatically on the next KOReader start — no changes to `main.lua` needed.

**Patches** are also **auto-discovered**: drop any `patch_*.lua` file into the `patches/` folder. Each patch file must return a table with two fields:

```lua
return {
    id    = "my_patch_id",       -- string, used in log messages
    apply = function() ... end,  -- called once after all plugins have initialised
}
```

A patch can monkey-patch any public function on any `require()`-able module — not just SimpleUI modules. If a patch fails (e.g. after a SimpleUI update), it is silently skipped and all other modules and patches continue to work normally.

## Built-in Patches

In addition to new modules, this plugin applies transparent patches to SimpleUI's built-in modules to add missing functionality.

<details>
<summary><b>Recent Books — Extra Options</b> — Multi-row layout, row spacing, and Exclude Paths for the built-in Recent Books module</summary>

### Recent Books — Extra Options

Adds extra display options to SimpleUI's built-in **Recent Books** module without modifying its source file:

**Features:**
- **Rows** — Show 1-4 rows of up to 5 books each (up to 20 books total), instead of the fixed single row
- **Row Spacing** — Adjustable vertical spacing between rows (0-300%); only shown when Rows > 1
- **Exclude Paths from Recent** — Comma-separated path fragments; books whose path contains any fragment are skipped (identical to the filter on Cover Deck, Hero Currently Reading, etc.)

**Settings (via Arrange Modules → Recent Books):**

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Rows | Number of rows of recent books to display (1-4, default: 1) |
| Row Spacing | Vertical spacing between rows (0-300%, default: 100%); only active when Rows > 1 |
| Exclude Paths from Recent | Comma-separated path fragments; books whose path contains any fragment are skipped (e.g. `/mnt/onboard/rss, instapaper, cache`) |

**Note:** When **Show Frame** or **Solid Background** is enabled on the Recent Books module, each row is rendered as its own bordered/background card rather than a single unified box. This patch is disabled by default (opt-in). Enable it via **Tools → SimpleUI Extra → Patches**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cover Deck — Exclude Paths from Recent</b> — Filter books from Cover Deck's Recent Books source</summary>

### Cover Deck — Exclude Paths from Recent

When the Cover Deck source is set to **Recent Books**, this patch adds an **Exclude Paths from Recent** filter (identical to the one on Hero Currently Reading and Recent Book Stats).

**Setting (via Arrange Modules → Cover Deck):**

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Exclude Paths from Recent | Comma-separated path fragments; books whose path contains any fragment are excluded from the Recent Books source (e.g. `/mnt/onboard/rss, instapaper, cache`) |

The filter has no effect when the source is set to **To Be Read**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cover Deck — Description Strip</b> — Show book descriptions below/above the carousel</summary>

---

## Usage

### How to Use This Plugin

After installation, SimpleUI Extra provides two types of enhancements:

1. **Modules** — New homescreen cards that you can add to your SimpleUI layout
2. **Patches** — Modifications to existing SimpleUI modules and KOReader features

---

### Managing Modules

**Enabling a module:**

1. Open KOReader and go to the **SimpleUI homescreen**
2. Tap the **top bar** to open the SimpleUI menu
3. Select **Arrange Modules** (or the homescreen layout editor)
4. Find the module by name (e.g. "Hero Currently Reading", "Reading Streaks")
5. **Enable** the module using the toggle
6. **Drag** it to your desired position in the layout
7. Tap **Save** and return to the homescreen

**Configuring module settings:**

1. In **Arrange Modules**, tap the module name
2. Adjust settings like:
   - **Scale** — Resize the card
   - **Show Frame** — Add borders
   - **Solid Background** — Fill background color
   - Module-specific options (varies by module)
3. Changes apply immediately after saving

**Disabling a module (performance):**

If you want to completely disable a module from loading (not just hide it from the layout):

1. Go to **Tools → SimpleUI Extra**
2. Find the module under **Modules**
3. Toggle it **off**
4. **Restart KOReader** for changes to take effect

This improves startup performance by preventing the module from loading at all.

---

### Managing Patches

**Patches are disabled by default** and must be explicitly enabled.

**Enabling a patch:**

1. Go to **Tools → SimpleUI Extra**
2. Find the patch under **Patches** section
3. Toggle it **on**
4. **Restart KOReader** for the patch to apply

**Available patches:**

- **Recent Books — Extra Options** — Multi-row layout, row spacing, and Exclude Paths for the built-in Recent Books module
- **Cover Deck — Exclude Paths from Recent** — Filter books from Cover Deck's Recent Books source
- **Cover Deck — Description Strip** — Show book descriptions below/above the carousel
- **Module Copies** — Place the same module on multiple homescreen pages
- **Clock: Chinese Date Format** — Replace clock date with Chinese format (6月3日 周三)
- **SimpleUI Home Screen on Sleep Screen** — Display your homescreen as the screensaver
- **Reading Insights on Sleep Screen** — Display Reading Insights statistics as the screensaver

**Disabling a patch:**

1. Go to **Tools → SimpleUI Extra**
2. Toggle the patch **off**
3. **Restart KOReader**

---

### Quick Start Example

**Goal:** Add a hero card showing your current book with a reading streak counter.

1. **Install** the plugin (see Installation section)
2. **Restart** KOReader
3. Open **SimpleUI homescreen** → tap top bar → **Arrange Modules**
4. **Enable** "Hero Currently Reading" and drag it to the top
5. **Enable** "Reading Streaks" and drag it below the hero card
6. Tap **Save**
7. Your homescreen now shows both modules!

**Optional:** Enable the "Cover Deck — Description Strip" patch:
1. Go to **Tools → SimpleUI Extra → Patches**
2. Enable **"Cover Deck — Description Strip"**
3. **Restart** KOReader
4. Go to **Arrange Modules → Cover Deck → Description**
5. Enable the description strip and configure position/alignment

---

## Toggle System

**Enable/disable modules and patches** via **Tools → SimpleUI Extra**:
- **Modules**: Enabled by default, can be disabled to improve startup performance
- **Patches**: Disabled by default (opt-in), enable only what you need
- **Restart required** after toggling

Settings stored in `settings/simpleui_ext.lua`.

---

## Adding Modules

**Auto-discovery**: Drop `module_yourname.lua` into `modules/` folder.

**Required fields**:
```lua
local M = {}
M.id = "yourname"  -- Must match filename: module_yourname.lua
M.name = "Your Module Name"
M.description = "Short description for toggle menu"
M.default_enabled = true  -- Loaded by default (optional, defaults to true)
-- ... rest of SimpleUI module contract
return M
```

**Rule**: `M.id` must match filename (`module_<id>.lua`)

---

## Adding Patches

**Auto-discovery**: Drop `patch_yourname.lua` into `patches/` folder.

**Required fields**:
```lua
local PATCH_ID = "yourname"  -- Must match filename: patch_yourname.lua

local P = {}
P.id = PATCH_ID
P.name = "Your Patch Name"
P.description = "Short description for toggle menu"
P.default_enabled = false  -- Patches default to disabled (opt-in)
P.apply = function()
    -- Monkey-patch code here
end
return P
```

**Rules**:
- `P.id` must match filename (`patch_<id>.lua`)
- Use `PATCH_ID` constant for consistency
- `apply()` called once after all plugins initialize

**Advanced: Using the Hotfix Utility**

For patches that need to replace nested functions (upvalues) in existing modules, use the `hotfix` utility:

```lua
local hotfix = require "utils/hotfix"

-- Replace a nested function by path
local err = hotfix(newFunction, module.publicFunction, "publicFunction -> nestedFunction")
if err then
    logger.warn("Failed to apply hotfix: " .. err)
end
```

**How it works:**
- Uses `debug.getupvalue` and `debug.setupvalue` to walk the upvalue chain
- Path format: `"parent -> child -> target"` (e.g., `"build -> _localDate"`)
- Returns `nil` on success, or an error message string on failure

**Example:** See `patch_clock_date_cn.lua` for a complete example of replacing SimpleUI Clock's date formatter.

**Note:** The hotfix utility was contributed by [@yefq](https://github.com/yefq) in [PR #4](https://github.com/omer-faruq/simpleui_ext.koplugin/pull/4).
