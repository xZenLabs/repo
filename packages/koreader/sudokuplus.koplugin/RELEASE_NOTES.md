# v1.1.0 · 2026-08-22

### Added
- **Custom Strategy Practice Mode**:
  - Target and practice specific solving strategies on demand across Medium, Hard, Master, and Expert tiers.
  - Multi-select strategy picker to practice individual techniques or custom combinations.
  - Dedicated training modes and clear explanations for **X-Chain** and **XY-Chain** chain logic.
- **Improved Hint Engine & Batch Eliminations**:
  - Step 3 now applies all candidate eliminations deduced by a technique instance at once (e.g. clearing all obsolete notes for a Locked Candidates or Naked/Hidden Subset in a single tap).
  - Look around without losing your place: inspect the board, cycle digits, toggle notes, or change cell selection without dismissing an active hint banner.
  - Applying hint eliminations with notes disabled automatically materializes remaining legal candidates on affected cells.
  - Hint requests are deduplicated per board state so inspecting hints repeatedly does not penalize statistics.
- **Statistics & Game History Enhancements**:
  - Browse seamlessly across games in the history log using previous/next buttons (`◀`/`▶`), hardware page-turn keys, arrow keys, or swipe gestures without closing the view.
  - Formatted puzzle seeds (`Seed: 4354 5433 …`) and required solving techniques displayed in victory dialogs and game details for easy sharing and replaying.
  - Spoiler protection: required techniques and strategy rankings remain hidden for active in-progress games until completed.
  - Dedicated statistics tracking and history breakdown for Custom practice mode alongside standard difficulty tiers.
  - Redesigned game detail view with adaptive mini-grid sizing and clean two-column stat pairing tailored for e-ink screens.

### Changed
- **Exact-Tier Puzzle Generation & Faster Creation**:
  - Standard difficulty requests now strictly match the chosen difficulty without falling back to nearby tiers.
  - Generator hot paths are significantly optimized, creating Master and Expert puzzles more than twice as fast.
  - Clean Retry / Cancel dialog with search budget escalation if an exact match requires more attempts.
- **Enhanced Save Safety & Session Reliability**:
  - Automatic game checkpoints on pause, device sleep, and app exit prevent lost progress.
  - Graceful recovery options (Retry / Discard) if storage writes encounter errors.
  - Complete plugin module isolation to ensure smooth, conflict-free operation alongside KOReader and other plugins.
- **Difficulty Progression Realignment**:
  - Reclassified **Swordfish** into Master tier alongside X-Wing and Skyscraper for a smoother difficulty curve.
