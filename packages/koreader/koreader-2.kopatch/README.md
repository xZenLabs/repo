# KOReader.patches

Useful patches for [<img src="img/koreader.png" width="24" /> KOReader](https://koreader.rocks) that I have either compiled, edited, or created myself.

### [🞂 2-dim-during-refresh.lua](2-dim-during-refresh.lua)
This patch lowers the brightness during refreshes in night mode to prevent bright flashes on e-ink.
Based on [this post by LexamusPrime](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreader/comments/1q9g37j/keep_dark_mode_dark).

It can be configured under **🞂 Screen 🞂 Dim frontlight on refreshes** on the <sub><img src="img/appbar.settings.svg" style="width:2%; height:auto;"></sub> **Settings** tab.

It has the following options:
- A toggle to enable dimming.
- A toggle to force dimming every page turn/refresh.
- A toggle for dimming on UI refreshes.
- A toggle for dimming in the reader only.
- A toggle to dim relative to the current brightness.
- A numeric stepper for the level of dimming (absolute/relative).

### [🞂 2-filemanager-next-prev-page-actions.lua](2-filemanager-next-prev-page-actions.lua)

### [🞂 2-percent-badge.lua](2-percent-badge.lua)
This patch adds a customizable badge that displays the percentage read for each book. It also displays whether a book has been completed or paused.

It has inline option variables at the start of the file.

In comparison to the original, it adds two new additional features:
- The ability to not be inverted in night mode when used together with the [UI background color patch](#-2-ui-background-colorlua).
- The inline option to exclude the text color from being modified by the [UI font color patch](#-2-ui-font-colorlua).

### [🞂 2-rounded-covers.lua](2-rounded-covers.lua)
This patch adds rounded corners to the book covers in the file browser.

The core feature that distinguishes this version is that it is background-agnostic, meaning that it works on any background without requiring any corner icons. Due to that, this patch works well with the [Appearance plugin](https://github.com/Euphoriyy/appearance.koplugin).

Based on the [original patch by SeriousHornet](https://github.com/SeriousHornet/KOReader.patches?tab=readme-ov-file#-2--rounded-coverslua).

### [🞂 2-custom-widgets.lua](2-custom-widgets.lua)
This patch adds support for custom widgets that can be used by other patches and plugins.

Widgets are auto-loaded from: `<koreader_dir>/widgets/`

Each .lua file in that directory is loaded and registered under its
filename (without the .lua extension). For example:
    widgets/colorwheelwidget.lua  →  "colorwheelwidget"

Information on how to use it in patches/plugins can be found in the patch comments.

## Widgets

Widgets allow for additional functionality for patches. Developers use them to provide unique ways to configure options.

### *How do I install widgets?*
You can install widgets by using the [custom widgets patch](#-2-custom-widgetslua). After installing that patch, you have to create a custom `widgets` folder (just like the `patches` folder) inside of the `koreader directory`. Any widgets can now be placed inside this new `widgets` folder.

### [🞂 colorwheelwidget.lua](widgets/colorwheelwidget.lua)

Adds a visual color wheel for selecting colors. It can be used with numerous different options.

The options are:
- `title_text`
- `width`
- `width_factor`
- `hue`
- `saturation`
- `value`
- `invert_in_night_mode`
- `draw_scale`
- `cancel_text`
- `apply_text`
