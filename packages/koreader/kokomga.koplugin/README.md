# KOReader Komga Client Plugin (kokomga)

A KOReader plugin that connects to your Komga server. It provides a native library browser to check your Komga catalog, download books directly to your device, and keep your reading progress perfectly synchronized.

## Highlights

* **Catalog Browsing**: Explore your entire Komga server—including libraries, collections, one-shots, recently added, and on-deck books—with cover thumbnails, list or grid views, and read status filters.
* **Bookshelf Integration**: Add Komga shelves—All Series with Komga's sorting and filters, Keep Reading, On Deck, recent series and books, one-shots, and collections—to the [Bookshelf](https://github.com/AndyHazz/bookshelf.koplugin) home screen, with read-state badges, and download books straight from them.
* **Bulk Downloads**: Easily queue multiple books or download all remaining unread books in a series directly from the browser view.
* **Background Pre-Downloading & Chapter Cleanup**: Pre-download the next $N$ chapters sequentially in the background while reading, and optionally keep only the last $N$ chapters of a series on your device, removing finished ones as you move on.
* **Smart Next-Chapter Transition**: When you turn the last page, the plugin can instantly open the next book if it's already on your device—even offline—or download it over Wi-Fi and open it automatically.
* **Automatic Book & Folder Metadata**: Downloads automatically fetch rich metadata (authors, summaries, and series indexes) and save folder cover art for file browser plugins.
* **Progress Syncing**: Keep your reading progress in sync directly with your Komga server, without needing to configure it as a KOSync server.
* **Auto RTL for Manga**: Automatically sets your reading layout to Right-to-Left (RTL) when opening manga matched with your Komga server.
