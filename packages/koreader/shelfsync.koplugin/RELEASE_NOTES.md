# 1.4.0

##### Plugin
- Prevent title auto-linking from selecting unrelated search results by checking title and author similarity. Wikipedia and WikiReader EPUBs are excluded from linking and syncing.
- Add Pagebound sync support with email/password login, book linking, status updates, and page/percentage progress sync.
- Pagebound notes are published to the linked book's forum with a title showing progress and page position.
- Fixed on-demand Wi-Fi shutting off while provider requests were still running; restored Wi-Fi now stays on until all queued operations finish.

# 1.3.3

##### Plugin
- Add StoryGraph email/password login under **Account (Cookies & Tokens) > Log in**, using the mobile app's login flow and saving the returned session cookies without storing your password. Login errors identify whether the page load or submission was blocked, and manual browser-cookie entry remains available as a fallback.

# 1.3.2

##### Plugin
- Add a **ShelfSync: Update progress for all linked books** gesture under KOReader's General actions, which immediately syncs the open book's current progress to every linked provider in sequence and reports each provider's result. Gesture-triggered sync now refreshes an unknown remote reading status first, instead of incorrectly treating it as a status mismatch.
- Fable now caches the login password on the device, encrypted at rest where possible, so an expired or revoked session can silently re-authenticate without asking for the password again. Logging out clears the cached password as well as the session tokens.

# 1.3.1

##### Plugin
- Add an "Automatically link by provider identifier" setting, which takes priority over ISBN and title+author matching when auto-linking a book: Goodreads via a `goodreads:<id>` metadata tag, Hardcover via its existing `hardcover:`/`hardcover-edition:` tags, StoryGraph via its existing `storygraph:`/`storygraph-edition:` tags. New auto-link priority order is identifier -> ISBN -> title+author. Fable has no matching identifier scheme yet.

# 1.3.0

##### Plugin
- Add Fable sync support alongside StoryGraph, Hardcover, and Goodreads (linking, progress/note updates, and background sync), using Fable's official API. Unlike the other services, Fable has a real login API, so the plugin logs in directly with your Fable email and password rather than a cookie/token fetched by hand — see the README's Fable authentication section, including a note for accounts that signed up via Google/Apple.
- The StoryGraph, Hardcover, Goodreads, and Fable sub-menus are now combined into a single **Providers** sub-menu (previously listed directly under ShelfSync), and **Common settings** is renamed to **Settings**.
