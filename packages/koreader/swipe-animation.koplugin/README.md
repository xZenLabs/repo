# Swipe_Animation

A software page-turn animation patch for KOReader that provides a smooth "wipe / erase and reveal" effect.

This patch brings fluid page turn animations to devices that lack native hardware support (or as an enhanced experience on supported devices).

## Features

* Smooth and faster page-turn animations
* Reduces screen flickering during page turns
* Customizable full refresh interval to control ghosting
  *(Automatic refresh on chapter changes and image pages is currently not supported.)*
* Supports page-turn gestures in all directions
* Improved experience in Night Mode
* **New:** MTK device support (Kobo, Kindle 2022 and newer)
* **New:** Page-turn animation support for fixed-layout formats such as PDF, DjVu, and CBZ
* **New:** Adjustable animation delay (in milliseconds) for both portrait and landscape orientations through
  **Settings (⚙) → Gesture Manager → Page Turn Animation Settings**, eliminating the need to edit Lua files manually
* **New:** Customizable refresh mode with three options: **UI**, **Partial**, and **Fast**

## Installation

> **Important:** Back up your `koreader` directory before installing.

### Kindle / Kobo (Linux Version)
1. Connect your device to your computer via USB.
2. **Back up** your existing `koreader` folder.
3. Copy the `ffi`, `frontend`, and `patches` folders from the extracted package into your device's `koreader` directory, and **merge/overwrite** the existing folders.
   **Do not delete the original folders.**
   * Typical path: `D:\.adds\koreader\`
   * **Note:** If your device already supports native hardware page-turn animations and you only want to enable native animations for PDF files, simply copy the `patches` folder into the `koreader` directory instead of installing the full patch.
4. Safely eject the device and restart KOReader.
5. Enable the animation:
   * Open any book.
   * Go to **Settings (⚙) → Gesture Manager → Page Turning**.
   * Enable **Page Turn Animation**.
6. *(Optional)* Adjust the animation delay:
   * Open **Settings (⚙) → Gesture Manager → Page Turn Animation Settings**.
   * Configure separate animation delays (ms) for portrait and landscape mode.

### Android E-Ink Devices
Applicable to Android versions of KOReader running on devices such as **BOOX, iReader, Hanvon, Xiaomi**, and other Android-based e-readers.
1. Connect your Android device.
2. From the extracted package, open the **Android Version** (`android_version`) folder.
3. Copy the `patches` folder into your device's `koreader` directory and merge it with the existing files.
   * If the `patches` folder does not exist, it will be created automatically.
4. Restart KOReader.

## Supported Devices
* **Fully tested:** Kobo devices, Kindle devices (including KV, KO, and KPW series), and most Linux-based e-ink devices running KOReader.
* **Android:** Android devices are **currently not supported**, as the animation performance is not satisfactory on the Android platform.
