# notes.koplugin

`notes.koplugin` is a plugin for KOReader to write handwritten notes.

## How to install?
Download the release package from the releases page. 

Extract the zip/archive into KOReader's `plugins` directory, and make sure the created folder name is 'notes.koplugin'.

## How to use it?
Once the app is loaded, you will see the `NEW: Notes` option under the tools menu. 

Draw using a stylus/hand in the canvas area.

Use the `<`,`>` icons inside the dialog window to change pages - new page will be created when needed.

Click the `X` icon at the top-right to close the plugin. (The notes will still be in memory when you open the plugin again)

Use the hamburger menu at the top-left to save the notes to a directory as png files.


## Project Goals
1. [x] Simple app to take notes while reading technical books.
2. [x] Support multi page notes 
3. [x] Save into storage as simple image files (.png)
4. [x] Load notes from storage
5. [ ] Multi-color pens
6. [x] Eraser (The icon doesn't show if the eraser is enabled or not at the moment)
7. [x] Clear page ~~/whole notes~~
8. [x] Setup a background / template for page

## Features not planned at the moment
1. Support undo/redo
2. Storing as vector graphics formats (svg, excalibre etc.)
3. Zoom-in/Zoom-out/pan
4. Palm rejection
5. Change canvas size when device is rotated

## Devices tested 
1. I am using my `Kobo Libra 2 Colour` with `Kobo stylus` for development and testing
2. I have an old `Samsung Galaxy Tab 3` and `stylus` which I can use to test Android (At the moment the app is making KOReader app itself to crash)

## How does it work 

When the plugin is visible, the gesture-detector in the core device/input  object is swapped out with a an interceptor, to get access to the touch events parsed by it.
The reason we have to do this is because the core doesn't give a mechanism to read the parsed touch events from input module.


# Known Issues
1. The Koreader app crashes in Android after using the plugin for some time. Not have had the time to debug that. 
1. There is no indication on Eraser icon whether its selected or not
