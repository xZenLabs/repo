# Ink Away

A **drawing** & **note-taking** app for KOReader, with **palm rejection** for stylus users. Draw or write with finger or stylus, take notes across a notebook, or annotate any PDF. You can export to a transparent PNG, a white JPEG or a paged PDF at your exact screen size.

## Features

- **Pen**: size, opacity, color (greys everywhere, full color + a wheel on color screens) and brusg styles (you can make your own brushes too).
- **Shapes & arrows** (line, curve, rectangle, ellipse, triangle, filled or outline): hold one in Pan mode to edit; plus a **paint bucket** for one-tap fills.
- **Eraser** that removes ink (back to transparent) instead of painting white.
- **Text boxes**: any installed font, bold/italic/underline/highlight, sizes and lists.
- **Lasso select**, four-way **symmetry**, and a **background image** to draw over.
- **Palm rejection**: rest your hand, only the pen draws (on by default on Kindle Scribe / reMarkable).
- **Notebook mode**: Keep a notebook with as many pages (lined/grid/dotted/Cornell) as you want, or open any PDF and write on it; export to a paged PDF.
- **Projects & autosave**, undo/redo, zoom & pan, and an optional grid.
- And more!

Toolbar: Pen, Shapes, Eraser, Pan, Zoom, Text, Undo/Redo, and Settings for more detailed customization.


## Installation

Copy the whole `ink-away.koplugin` folder into KOReader's `plugins` directory:

- Kindle: `koreader/plugins/ink-away.koplugin/`
- Kobo: `.adds/koreader/plugins/ink-away.koplugin/`
- Android: `koreader/plugins/ink-away.koplugin/` in app storage

Then restart KOReader. Open from Top menu → **Tools** tab → "Ink Away (drawing canvas)" near the top. You can also map it to a gesture in KOReader's gesture manager; the action is "Open Ink Away". 


## Notes

- Palm rejection needs KOReader 2026.07+.
- Files go in an "ink away" folder; saving keeps an editable project automatically.
- On e-ink, black ink refreshes faster than greys/white and a white pen is invisible on the white canvas, exports are unaffected.
