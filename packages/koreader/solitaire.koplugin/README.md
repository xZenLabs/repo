```lua
-- Card size (fraction of screen width)
self.card_width = math.floor(self.screen_width / 9)

-- Card height ratio
self.card_height = math.floor(self.card_width * 1.4)

-- Stack overlap (how much cards show when stacked)
self.stack_offset = math.floor(self.card_height * 0.35)

-- Draw-3 fan offset for waste pile
self.waste_fan_offset = math.floor(self.card_width * 0.3)
```

### Font Sizes

```lua
-- Rank font (A, 2, 3... K)
self.rank_font = Font:getFace("cfont", math.floor(self.card_width * 0.22))

-- Center suit symbol
self.suit_center_font = Font:getFace("cfont", math.floor(self.card_width * 0.30))
