# v2.0.0


- Fix for updater unarchive crashing koreader, introduced in 1.9.9

# v1.9.9


### Housekeeping

- Fix `About` information to show the branch information if running a dev branch instead of a release
- Housekeeping: cleaned up menu displays, reordered options section

# v1.9.2


- Other issue identified in issue #77 - the old restore where you left off code assumed there were only two options - in the reader or in the filebrowser. But with the use of new plugins to override the filebrowser (simpleui, etc.) that is no longer the fallback if not in reader. Fixed.

# v1.9.1


- Issue identified in #77 - old plugin schema wasn't migrating correctly resulting in plugin lists being reset and never unset.

# v1.9.0
