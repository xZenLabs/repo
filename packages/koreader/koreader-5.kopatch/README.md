# Visual Overhaul Suite (VOS) – Patches for KOReader

Some of the patches I created for KOReader (works with both Coverbrowser and Project: Title plugin).

**NOTE 1: Make sure you download the .lua files correctly using the download button. Please do not right click the file and 'save as', it won't work that way.**

**NOTE 2: If you want to use any of these patches, first you MUST install the `2--disable-all-CB-widgets.lua` for Coverbrowser or `2--disable-all-PT-widgets.lua` for Project: Title. Otherwise the patches may not work properly.**

All the .lua files should go into `koreader/patches` and all the .svg files should go into `koreader/icons` folder of your e-reader.

All these patches are tested on KOReader 2025.10 "Ghost" and Project: Title v3.5 and works perfectly.

So make sure your book's title contains the page number in this format if you are using coverbrowser. (I'll work on improving page detection mechanism for coverbrowser soon)
