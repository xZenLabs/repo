# pinpad_screenlock_plugin

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-orange.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A small plugin to enable locking the screen of KOReader with a PIN code.

This work was originally based on the work of yogi81 and their plugin `screenlock_koreader_plugin`.

## Setup

1. Put the latest release of `pinpadlockscreen.koplugin` into the `koreader/plugins` directory.
2. Activate and change your password through the menu in Settings -> Screen -> PIN Pad Lock.
The default code is "1234". You can also add a custom message to display with the pin pad (e.g. contact details) and change its position and text alignment. You can also jump lines using "\n" in the message.

**Note:**

- There's no limit to the number of digits your code may contain, but good luck if you forget your code (you'll have to dig into your memory or KOReader to find it back).
- You can change the lock logo by replacing the image from the icons folder. The new icon must be SVG file and be named `lock.svg`.

## Features and Gestures

- `Manage PIN Code`:
  - `Change PIN Code` will allow you to change your code after entering your current one.
  - `Reset PIN Code` will reset the code at `1234`, thought for people with long codes.

- `PIN pad lock message` allows you to manage the custom message you can add to the PIN Pad. This is optional.

- `Cancel` button: a quick tap will delete a digit of the code you entered, a long hold will delete every digits.

- `Advanced Settings`
  - You can choose the timeout time, the max number of tries before timeout, among other things.

- The pad will appear on the current screensaver you're using, except when first hooking into KOReader where it will appear on a black background.

- Check for updates directly from your device, without having to open GitHub. This feature needs the device to be connected to Internet.

## Future work

- Features : Currently have no idea, do not hesitate to bring up issues !
- Fix : Screen becomes full black and untouchable when suspending/powering off the device before unlocking the "hook Pin Pad"

**Note:** I do not know when I'll be implementing these features. Also, my work could probably be optimized so I'm open to any new ideas and remarks.

## Recent Features

- Customizable message on PIN pad lock.
- Menu Entry where everything is customizable without the need to restart KOReader or modify the code.
- Using dynamic persistence instead of hardcoded variables.
- Cancel button deletes one digits when entering PIN Code, hold it to delete everything.
- 3 tries limit before a 30 seconds timeout.
- PIN Pad appears on the screensaver background (without sleep message)
- When launching KOReader (on a jailbroken kindle), PIN Pad now appears right away, not leaving the possibility to deactivate or reset the lock.
- Easier installation process with the icon directly in the plugin.
- PIN Pad appearing on the current screensaver without having to rebuild everything.
- Can show digits when typing.
- Less flashy overall.
- Pin pad disappears when suspending device before unlocking the pad.
