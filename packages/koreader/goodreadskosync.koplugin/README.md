# goodreadskosync

Keep your KOReader reading in sync with Goodreads.

An unofficial, community KOReader plugin. Install it from **KOReader Storefront**
or manually from [Releases](https://github.com/gkgangavarapu/goodreadskosync/releases).

## Notes

- Sign-in goes through Amazon and can occasionally take a few tries; if it
  fails, wait a little and try again. Once signed in, the session is kept.

## Features

- **Sign in on-device** — log in to Goodreads from KOReader itself, with an
  on-device prompt if Amazon asks for extra verification, and automatic retries
  when the connection is flaky.
- **Over-the-air (OTA) updates:** checks GitHub Releases about once a day and can
  download, verify (SHA-256), install, and restart for you on request — no cable
  or manual copying needed.
- Automatically updates your shelves: **Want to Read**, **Currently Reading**, and **Read**.
- Syncs reading progress as you read, or on open/close, according to your chosen preset.
- Marks a book Read when you finish it (configurable), and offers a rating.
- Optional star ratings.
- Links a book to the best Goodreads match automatically, or lets you pick the right one.
- Manual controls: **Sync now**, **Set status**, **Rate this book**, **Find on Goodreads**.
- Reads your Goodreads shelf and never overwrites a book you have marked Read.
- Works offline and syncs when you reconnect; background sync never blocks reading.
- **Sync presets** (Fastest / Faster / Medium / Relaxed) and Wi‑Fi handled the
  KOReader way, so it never fights your device settings.
- Small, non-intrusive notifications.
- No analytics and no telemetry.

## Syncing

Syncs run in the background and never interrupt reading. Pick one preset
(**Settings → Sync preset**) — it sets all the sync behaviour for you:

| Preset | Reading progress | Regular check |
|---|---|---|
| **Medium** (default) | on open/close | every 15 minutes |
| Fastest | as you read (every 2%) | every 2 minutes |
| Faster | as you read (every 5%) | every 5 minutes |
| Relaxed | on open/close | never |

Every preset also syncs on these events — the preset only changes the in‑reading
updates above:

| Trigger | Fastest | Faster | Medium | Relaxed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open / close | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Sleep / wake / reconnect | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Status change, new link, sign‑in, **Sync now** | yes | yes | yes | yes |

- Automatic syncs never switch Wi-Fi on; they run when you are already online
  and otherwise wait for the next connection. **Sync now** will prompt to turn
  Wi-Fi on if it is needed.
- A sync fetches your latest shelf on book open, on manual sync, or about once
  an hour; otherwise it reuses the last result, so routine syncs stay quick.
- Offline changes are saved and sent automatically when you reconnect; the open
  book's progress is pushed as soon as you are back online.
- A new book opened while offline is linked automatically once you are back
  online (when **Link books automatically** is on).
- Opening a book does not change its shelf until there is progress.
- When you finish a book it is marked **Read**.
- Newly linked books are added to **Currently Reading** by default (turn this off in Settings).
- Small toasts keep you informed while staying out of the way (linking, offline
  saves/flushes, Currently Reading, and sync failures).
