# v1.2.4 · 2026-08-18

## KOReader compatibility

- Restores **Add to VD**, **VD +AI**, and **Define (VD)** in dictionary popups on KOReader 2026.07.
- Uses KOReader 2026.07's supported archive reader for OTA extraction while retaining the legacy paths needed by KOReader 2026.03.
- Installs the published release ZIP, reports detailed extraction/install errors, and preserves local `vocabdeck_apikeys.lua` and `vocabdeck_configuration.lua` files during OTA updates.

## Study and network fixes

- Includes manually defined and non-AI-enriched cards in study by default. **Study only enriched cards** remains available as an opt-in setting.
- Updates the manual to point to the Dashboard and language deck entries instead of the removed top-level Study item.
- Opens KOReader's Wi-Fi prompt immediately when the radio is off, avoiding the long DNS timeout before single-card or bulk AI enrichment.

## One-time recovery for KOReader 2026.07

If KOReader 2026.07 is running a VocabDeck version older than 1.2.3, **Check for updates cannot install this release** because that installed updater calls an archive API removed by KOReader.

1. Download `vocabdeck.koplugin.zip` from this release.
2. Keep copies of `vocabdeck_apikeys.lua` and `vocabdeck_configuration.lua` if you use them.
3. Manually replace the VocabDeck plugin files, restore those two private files if necessary, and restart KOReader.
4. Future updates can use **Check for updates** normally.

Users on KOReader 2026.03 do not need this recovery. Existing VocabDeck 1.2.3 installations already have the repaired updater and can update normally.
