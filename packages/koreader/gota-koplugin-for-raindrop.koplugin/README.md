## Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release or clone this repository
2. Copy the `gota.koplugin` folder to your KOReader plugins directory
3. Restart KOReader

### Method 2: From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cristenger/gota.koplugin-for-raindrop.git
cd gota.koplugin-for-raindrop
cp -r gota.koplugin /path/to/koreader/plugins/
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Raindrop.io Test Token

1. Go to [Raindrop.io App Management Console](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations)
2. Click **"Create new app"** (or open an existing app)
3. Give it a name (e.g., "KOReader")
4. Copy the **"Test token"** from your app settings

**Why Test Tokens?** No setup required, never expires, secure, and perfect for e-readers.

**Note:** OAuth tokens are not supported (require web browser).

### 2. Configure the Plugin

1. Open KOReader
2. Go to: **Menu → Gota → Configuration → Configure access token**
3. Paste your token
4. Tap **Save** (or **Test** to verify first)

*First time shows "NEW: Gota" - this disappears after opening it once.*

### 3. Start Reading!

Once configured, you can:

- **All articles**: Browse all your bookmarks
- **View collections**: Navigate your organized collections
- **Search articles**: Quick text search
- **Advanced search**: Filter by tags and content type

## Usage Guide

### Browse Collections

```
Menu → Gota → View collections
```
Shows all your Raindrop collections with article counts and pagination.

### Search Articles

**Simple Search:** `Menu → Gota → Search articles`
- Enter any search term to find matching articles

**Advanced Search:** `Menu → Gota → Advanced search`
- Filter by tags (e.g., `#programming`) or content type (article/image/video/document)

### Read an Article

Tap any article to see options:
- **Open in full reader**: HTML with formatting (requires Raindrop PRO)
- **View as plain text**: Simple text view (requires Raindrop PRO)
- **View information**: Metadata, tags, URL, cache status, notes, and highlights
- **Copy URL**: Copy article link

### Notes and Highlights

When viewing article information, you'll see:
- **Personal Notes**: Your notes about the article
- **Highlights**: Text you've highlighted with color indicators
  - [Yellow] [Blue] [Red] [Green] color tags
  - Highlight-specific notes when available
  
**Important:** Notes and highlights work with both free and PRO accounts. However, viewing cached article content (full text/HTML) requires a **Raindrop.io PRO subscription**.

### Configure Download Folder

`Menu → Gota → Configuration → Configure download folder`

Choose between visual folder picker or manual folder name entry.

## Language Support

The plugin auto-detects your KOReader language:
- **English** (default)
- **Spanish** (Español)

Change language in: `KOReader Settings → Language`

Want to add your language? See [l10n/README.md](gota.koplugin/l10n/README.md) for translation guide.

## Configuration

- **Access Token**: Configuration → Configure access token (required)
- **Download Folder**: Configuration → Configure download folder (default: `gota_articles/`)
- **Debug**: Configuration → Debug Raindrop API connection (troubleshooting)

## Troubleshooting

### Articles not showing?
1. Check you have articles in Raindrop.io
2. Verify token with "Test" button
3. Try "All articles" to see everything

### "No cached content available"
This means the article's permanent cache is not available. This can happen if:
- You're using a free Raindrop.io account (cache requires PRO)
- The article hasn't been cached yet (PRO users: wait a moment and try "reload")
- The article source doesn't allow caching

### SSL Certificate Issues

**Important:** SSL verification is disabled by default to prevent certificate errors on e-ink devices.

This is necessary because many e-readers have outdated certificate stores and cannot verify modern SSL certificates. The plugin disables SSL verification to ensure reliable connections to Raindrop.io API.

**Security note:** While this reduces security slightly, it's a necessary compromise for e-reader compatibility. Your access token is still transmitted over HTTPS encryption.
