## Settings

### Main Settings
- **Start/Stop RSVP**: Manual control for RSVP reading
- **Tap on Text to Launch RSVP**: Enable/disable tap-to-start functionality
- **Show Reading Position**: Toggle position indicator when resuming
- **Preview Words**: Set number of words to display (1-10)
- **Optimal Alignment (OVP)**: Align words around the focus crosshair (monospace) or center them with standard spacing
- **RSVP Speed**: Comprehensive speed control options

### Speed Presets
- **100 WPM**: Very slow (beginners)
- **150 WPM**: Slow (comfortable reading)
- **200 WPM**: Normal (average reading speed)
- **250 WPM**: Fast (experienced readers)
- **300 WPM**: Very fast (advanced users)
- **400 WPM**: Extreme (speed reading experts)
- **500 WPM**: Ultra fast (maximum speed)

## Tips for Effective Speed Reading

1. **Start Slow**: Begin with 150-200 WPM and gradually increase
2. **Focus on Comprehension**: Speed is useless without understanding
3. **Use Preview Words**: Set to 3-5 words for better context
4. **Regular Practice**: Consistency improves reading speed over time
5. **Minimize Subvocalization**: Avoid "hearing" words in your head
6. **Use Resume Feature**: Take breaks and resume exactly where you left off

## Troubleshooting

### RSVP Won't Start
- Ensure the document has extractable text
- Try manually starting RSVP from the menu first
- Check that tap-to-launch is enabled in settings

### Text Extraction Issues
- Some PDF files may have non-extractable text
- Try converting to EPUB format for better compatibility
- Ensure the document is not password-protected

### Performance Issues
- Reduce preview word count if the interface feels slow
- Lower the reading speed if words appear too quickly
- Restart KOReader if the plugin becomes unresponsive
