# FolderMemory.koplugin

A KOReader plugin that remembers per-folder settings and restores them automatically when you return to a folder.

## What it does

When you navigate into a folder, **FolderMemory** remembers and restores:

- **Sort order** (by name, date, size, etc.)
- **Reverse sort** direction
- **Folders and files mixed** toggle
- **Book status filter** (new, reading, abandoned, complete, or any combination)
- **Display mode**: classic (filenames only), mosaic (cover images or text covers), detailed list (with images, metadata, or filenames)
- **Items per page**: mosaic grid columns × rows (portrait and landscape), list mode files per page, and classic mode items per page. **Configure this folder** only offers the entries that apply to the current display mode and to the orientation the device is held in; **Default settings for folders** and **Global settings for other views** always list them all, since they describe folders and views as they may be later

### Inheritance from parent folders
If a folder has no saved settings of its own, the plugin walks up the directory tree and uses the nearest ancestor's settings. If none is found, it falls back to a global default template you can configure.

This means you can save settings once on `Books/` and all subfolders (`Books/Fantasy/`, `Books/Sci-Fi/`, etc.) will inherit them — unless you override a specific folder. When inheritance is disabled, every folder without its own settings goes directly to the default template.

### Default settings for folders

A `__default__` template is auto-created from your current KOReader settings on first install. You can edit it anytime via **Folder memory → Default settings for folders** without affecting your current folder — it is the fallback for folders that have no saved settings of their own (and, with inheritance on, no ancestor with any either).

It is **not** a global default: it changes how folders behave and nothing else. The settings that the views outside the file browser — History, Favorites, Collections, OPDS, Calibre, search results — actually read are KOReader's own global ones, and those live in **Folder memory → Global settings for other views**.

## How it works

- **Auto-save** — any change you make to sort, display mode, grid, or book status filter via KOReader's native menus or the Folder Memory menu is automatically captured and saved for the current folder.
- **Seamless restore** — settings are applied automatically when entering a folder
- **No global side effects** — items per page (including classic mode) and the mosaic grid are remembered per folder without touching KOReader's global settings. Collections, OPDS, History and search results keep their own values instead of inheriting the settings of the last folder you visited. A folder with a saved value always wins over those globals.
- **Explicit global editing** — the one place the plugin does write KOReader's global settings is **Global settings for other views**, and it says so. Nothing there is saved per folder.
- **KOReader's "Use this mode everywhere" and per-folder display mode** — with that toggle on (Settings → Display mode), CoverBrowser applies the file browser's mode to History and Collections, so entering a folder whose saved display mode differs also changes those two views. Turning the toggle off does not restore their earlier modes.

## Installation

Copy the `foldermemory.koplugin` folder to `koreader/plugins/` and restart KOReader.

## Usage

From the file browser, open the menu (top-left) → **Folder memory**:

| Menu item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Configure this folder** | Open a settings window for the current folder: sort, display mode, items per page, and book status filter. Changes are saved automatically and applied immediately. The Dispatcher action below opens the same window. |
| **Clear saved settings for this folder** | Remove the current folder's saved settings — it will inherit from parent folders or fall back to defaults. |
| **Inherit settings from parent folders** | Toggle inheritance on/off. When off, folders without their own settings skip ancestors and go directly to the default template. |
| **Default settings for folders** | Edit the `__default__` template. These changes never affect your current folder — they only define the fallback for folders without saved settings of their own. They do not change KOReader's global settings, so History, Collections, OPDS and search results are unaffected. |
| **Global settings for other views** | Edit KOReader's and CoverBrowser's global settings — the ones History, Favorites, Collections, OPDS, Calibre and search results read: items per page (the only one that reaches OPDS and Calibre, which do not use CoverBrowser), the mosaic and detailed-list grid, and the display mode of History and Collections. Deliberately not saved per folder, so a folder with its own saved value keeps it. KOReader's "use this mode everywhere" toggle is not repeated here — it stays next to the mode choices in Settings → Display mode, and turns these two off while it is on. |
| **Clear all saved folder settings** | Remove all per-folder memory. The default settings for folders are preserved. |

### Gesture shortcut

**Configure this folder** is also registered as a Dispatcher action, so you can bind it to a gesture: *Settings → Taps and gestures → Gesture manager*, pick a gesture, then choose **File browser → Folder memory: configure this folder**. The gesture opens a settings window for the folder you are currently browsing — no need to go through the menu. Settings with several choices (sort order, book status, display mode) open a second window listing them.

## Compatibility

Tested on KOReader 2026.03 "Snowflake" and nightly. Should work on any recent version. Requires CoverBrowser plugin for display mode and grid features (the plugin gracefully degrades if CoverBrowser is not installed).
