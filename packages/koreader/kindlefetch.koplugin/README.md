Download books from Anna's Archive directly to your Kindle, entirely within the KOReader app.

## Overview

KindleFetch integrates Anna's Archive and Library Genesis into KOReader, allowing you to search for and download books without leaving your e-reader. The plugin handles the entire workflow - from search queries to file downloads - with an intuitive interface and robust error handling.

## Features

- **Book Search + Downloads**: Query Anna's Archive from your device with simple text input and download with a tap from Library Genesis
- **Caching**: Caches search results (72 hours), mirror URLs (7 days), and book covers (for length of search) to minimise network requests and improve performance
- **Preferences**: Filter results by preferred languages, file types, and book types
- **Book Cover Previews**: Display cover images in download previews
- **Download Progress**: Visual download progress bar with real-time file size information
- **Background Downloads**: Downloads run in the background using curl, with non-blocking UI updates
- **Automatic Curl Updates**: Ensures a compatible curl version (8.17.0+) is available
- **Automatic Retry Logic**: Fallback to other available urls if connection fails
- **Safe File Handling**: Automatic filename sanitisation and directory management

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the latest stable release of KOReader installed (the nightly release has been known to cause issues with this plugin)

2. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/william-spongberg/KindleFetch.koplugin/releases) tab

3. Unzip and move its contents into the `plugins` folder of KOReader

```

### Workflow

1. **Settings & Filtering** (`SettingsPage`)
   - User can customise preferred languages
   - User can select preferred file types: ebooks (EPUB, MOBI, AZW, etc.), comics (CBR, CBZ), documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.), images, or web formats
   - User can filter by book type: fiction, non-fiction, comics, or standards documents
   - Download directory can be changed from a file browser
   - All settings are persisted and applied to future searches

2. **Search Phase** (`AnnasAPI`)
   - User enters a search query via InputDialog
   - Plugin resolves the current Anna's Archive mirror URL (with weekly caching)
   - Plugin scrapes Anna's Archive HTML search results page
   - HTML table is parsed to extract book metadata (title, authors, year, language, file type, MD5 hash, cover image URL)
   - Results are cached (72 hours max, 100 entries) to minimise requests
   - Search results are displayed in a menu

3. **Download Phase** (`LlgiAPI`)
   - User selects a book and optionally changes the save location via DownloadPrompt
   - Book cover image is fetched and cached locally
   - Plugin resolves the current Library Genesis mirror URL (with weekly caching)
   - Curl fetches the ads page using the book's MD5 hash to obtain a download URL
   - File size is determined from HTTP headers for progress calculation
   - A curl process is spawned to download the file in the background
   - Progress widget updates every 0.5 seconds with percentage and file size information
   - On completion, file is saved to the configured download directory

4. **Error Handling & Resilience**
   - Network connectivity is verified before searching
   - Failed downloads automatically retry through a configured proxy (if `PROXY_URL` env var is set)
   - Mirror URLs are dynamically scraped from Wikipedia if cached URLs fail
   - User can cancel downloads at any time via the progress widget
   - All temporary files, exit code files, and background processes are cleaned up on completion or cancellation
   - Curl version is checked on startup; static curl (8.17.0) is automatically installed if needed

### Environment Variables

The plugin supports an optional `PROXY_URL` environment variable for proxy-based downloads:

```bash
export PROXY_URL="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
```

If a direct download fails, the plugin automatically retries through the proxy.

## Attribution

This plugin is forked from [justrals/KindleFetch](https://github.com/justrals/KindleFetch). It uses a similar underlying logic, but focuses on easy UX and simplicity. The choice was made to only support downloads from Library Genesis due to limitiations and complexity surrounding Z-Library downloads.
