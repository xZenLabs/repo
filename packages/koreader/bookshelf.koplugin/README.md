# Bookshelf

A friendly home screen for KOReader. Browse your library by series, author, genre, collection, or anything you like; pick a book, glance at its cover, blurb, rating, and progress, and start reading. A build-your-own [start menu](#the-start-menu) puts your shortcuts, folders, and live panels a tap away in the corner.

## Install

1. Download the latest **bookshelf.koplugin.zip** from [Releases](https://github.com/AndyHazz/bookshelf.koplugin/releases).
2. Unzip it onto your device's KOReader plugins folder:

   | Device | Plugins folder |
   |--------|----------------|
   | Kindle | `/mnt/us/koreader/plugins/` |
   | Kobo | `/mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/` |
   | Android | `<koreader-dir>/plugins/` |

3. Restart KOReader.
4. Open KOReader's menu and set **Start with -> Bookshelf**. Without this, KOReader opens its standard file browser on launch; you can still open Bookshelf manually from the menu.

   > The **Start with** setting only appears in the menu of KOReader's **File Manager** screen, not while a book is open. If you can't find it, close the book first (or launch KOReader without one open), then open the menu from the file browser.

> **You also need CoverBrowser enabled** (Settings -> More plugins -> CoverBrowser). It supplies the covers and metadata Bookshelf uses. If it's disabled, Bookshelf shows a one-time notice and steps aside to KOReader's standard file browser.

Once it's running, the top menu has a **Bookshelf** section with everything else: chips, the book detail view, collections, updates, and settings.

---

## A quick tour

### The chip bar (top of the screen)

Each "chip" is a shelf. Tap one to switch shelves. Out of the box you get **Home**, **Recent**, **Series**, and **Favourites**, but you can rename, reorder, hide, or delete any of them and add as many of your own as you like.

A chip can point at:

- **Home** -- your library as folders, or as a flat list of every book.
- **Recent** or **Latest** -- books you read recently, or books added recently.
- A **stack** of series, authors, genres, collections, formats, ratings, or reading statuses. Tap a stack to drill into one of its members.
- A **specific** series, author, genre, collection, format, rating, folder, or reading status -- a shelf showing just that one slice of your library.
- **Favourites** -- the built-in starred shelf.

Each chip remembers its own **filters** (reading status, genre, language, format, rating, collection, or folder -- see [Chip sources, filters, and sorts](#chip-sources-filters-and-sorts)), sort priority (up to three levels deep, e.g. *surname, then series, then series number*), label, icon, and whether it's enabled.

**To edit a chip:** long-press it. The footer of the editor has **+ Add new chip** if you'd like to start a fresh one.

The same menu (**menu -> Bookshelf chips…**) also has **Chip bar font size** for adjusting how big the chips render across the top of the screen.

When you have more chips than fit across the screen, the bar splits into pages: tap the **>** / **<** chevrons at the end of the row, or swipe left/right on the bar, to move between them (the active chip's page shows first). On e-ink the change plays as a wipe -- see [Animations](#animations).

### Searching

Tap the search icon at the right of the chip bar. Search looks across authors, series, genres, collections, and book titles in one go, and groups the results by category. Tapping a result drills into it; back-swipe to return to whichever shelf you were on.

Folder names aren't searched by default: in most libraries the folders mirror the author/series/genre stacks, so matching a folder just duplicates the metadata result of the same name. If you navigate by folder, turn on **Advanced settings -> Include folder names in search results**.

### The hero card (top of the shelf area)

The big card at the top of the screen previews the focused book. Tap a cover on the grid to focus it; the card refreshes with its title, author, description, rating, and progress. Tap the hero card cover to open the book.

The hero card has eight sections you can show, hide, or restyle:

- **Status line** -- top right; defaults to disk space, battery, frontlight, Wi-Fi, and time.
- **Rating** -- five tappable stars (off by default; tap a star to set or clear).
- **Title**
- **Author**
- **Metadata** -- a free-form line; the default shows the series and series number for books in a series.
- **Description** -- the book blurb. Tap to read the full text in a scrollable viewer.
- **Tags (interactive)** -- a strip of tappable pills for the book's author, series, genres, collections, and parent folder. Tap a pill to jump straight to that shelf. Off by default.
- **Progress** -- bottom-anchored line with an inline progress bar.

To edit them, open **menu -> Edit book detail view** (see [Customising the hero card](#customising-the-hero-card) below).

### Micro-modules on the home screen

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndyHazz/bookshelf.koplugin/master/assets/hero-grid.png" width="32%" alt="Home screen showing a grid of micro-modules" />
</p>

The home screen can show a grid of **micro-modules** -- small live panels like a clock, a quote from your highlights, your reading goal, the weather, or a launcher button. They're the same kinds of panels you can add to the [start menu](#micro-modules).

Micro-modules can appear in three independent places, each its own on/off checkbox under **Bookshelf settings -> Micro modules**:

- **In hero area** -- a **grid chip** at the right of the chip bar swaps the book preview at the top of the shelf for the grid (tap the chip to toggle between the two).
- **Full-screen button** -- a grid button sits in the footer opposite the start menu; tapping it opens the modules full-screen as a dashboard, with the status line across the top. Close it with the **X**, a tap on empty space, or Back. The usual KOReader gestures (top-edge menu, edge swipes for brightness, corner actions) still work over it.
- **In start menu** -- module cards appear in the [start menu](#micro-modules) launcher alongside your other items.

You can run any combination. The **hero** and **full-screen** views keep **separate module lists**, so you can show different modules in each -- the full-screen list starts as a copy of your hero modules and then the two diverge as you edit them. Turning all three off disables micro-modules entirely (a quick way to rule them out when troubleshooting).

In either grid:

- **Long-press a module** to move it, make it wider or narrower (`-` / `+`), add another from the picker (**+**), or remove it. In the hero grid you can also send a module to one of four **pages**; the full-screen view shows everything at once, so it has no pages.
- **Swipe left/right** on the hero grid, or tap the in-grid arrows, to flip between pages.
- **Long-press the grid chip** to reset the hero grid to its defaults, or to remove micro-modules from the hero area.
- On **physical-button (D-pad) devices**, move the cursor across the grid with the arrow keys, open a module with the centre key, and long-press to edit it.

The grid packs square modules (clocks, launcher icons) tightly and lets text modules fill the rest of the row. Set the number of **columns and rows** under **menu -> Settings -> Edit shelf size**. Hero micro-modules have their own entry under **menu -> Text size** so you can scale the grid independently of the book hero.

### The shelf grid (the books)

Each cover on the grid is either a book or a stack of books (for series, authors, etc.).

- **Tap** a book to preview it in the hero card.
- **Tap** the hero card cover to actually open the book.
- **Long-press** a book to open the book menu (see below).
- **Long-press** a stack to pin it to the chip bar as its own shelf.
- **Swipe up** to collapse the hero and show more books at once.
- **Swipe down** on the hero to restore it; **swipe down** on the shelf area to refresh the library after adding new books over USB or Calibre.

The full gesture reference is in [Gestures cheatsheet](#gestures-cheatsheet) below.

### Folder shortcuts and jump-to-folder gestures

If a KOReader folder shortcut, the "go to parent folder" or "go home" gesture, or any plugin points the file browser at a folder while Bookshelf is open, Bookshelf follows into that folder rather than leaving you on the previous shelf. The folder is added to the breadcrumb trail, so a back-swipe returns you to where you were. Opening an actual book still goes straight to the reader as usual.

---

## The start menu

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndyHazz/bookshelf.koplugin/master/assets/start-menu.png" width="32%" alt="Start menu open with a folder flyout" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndyHazz/bookshelf.koplugin/master/assets/micromodules.png" width="32%" alt="Micro-module picker" />
</p>

Tap the menu button in the bottom corner of the shelf, in line with the page arrows, to open a popup launcher you build yourself. Think of it as a Start menu for your home screen.

Each item can be:

- A **KOReader action** -- history, the reading calendar, Wi-Fi, night mode, sleep, frontlight, and anything else from KOReader's action list.
- A **menu action** -- capture any item from KOReader's own menus and replay it with one tap. Browse to the item, tap **Add as shortcut**, and it becomes a menu entry; toggle items (like Wi-Fi) show their current on/off state.
- **Another plugin** -- launch any installed plugin that has a menu entry (games included).
- A **Bookshelf action** -- the full Bookshelf menu (settings, the book detail editor, collections, and the rest), or exit Bookshelf.
- A **folder** -- group items together; it flies out to the side when you tap it.
- A **micro-module** -- a small live panel (see below).

**Building and editing it.** Long-press any item for **rename**, **change icon**, **move up / down**, **move into / out of a folder**, **show in** (home screen, reader, or both), **delete**, and **add new menu item**. Adding walks you through the categories above; the icon picker is a built-in glyph grid (no extra plugins needed). Folders open downward from the row you tapped, overlapping the menu so they read as connected.

**Position.** Under **Bookshelf settings -> Start menu** you can put the button on the **left**, the **right**, or turn it **off**. It works with touch and with physical-button (D-pad) devices.

**While reading.** Turn on **Bookshelf settings -> Show launcher button while reading** to keep a small launcher button in the reader's bottom corner. Tapping it opens the same start menu over your book, so you can jump to a shelf, a collection, or another plugin and tap straight back in. If you use full-screen [micro-modules](#micro-modules-on-the-home-screen), the grid button appears in the reader too. By default each menu item shows both on the home screen and while reading; use **show in** (above) to limit one to the reader or the home screen -- handy for keeping the reading menu short.

**By gesture (no button needed).** Prefer not to show a button? KOReader's **Gesture manager** (wrench -> Taps and gestures -> Gesture manager) lists two assignable actions, **Bookshelf: open start menu** and **Bookshelf: open micro-modules**. Bind either to any gesture -- a corner tap, a swipe, a multiswipe -- and it opens that view in the reader (or the library) whether or not the launcher buttons are shown. Because a bound gesture is a deliberate request, it works even if the start menu or micro-modules are set to **Off**.

### Micro-modules

Micro-modules are small live panels. Add them to the start menu through **Add new menu item -> Bookshelf micro-module…**, or to the [home-screen grid](#micro-modules-on-the-home-screen). The ones that ship with Bookshelf:

- **Clock** -- digital (12- or 24-hour) or analogue.
- **Quote of the day** -- a highlight drawn from your own books, refreshed daily or on every open. Tapping it can roll a new quote, open that book's bookmark list, or open the book at the highlight.
- **Reading goal** -- progress towards a daily reading target.
- **Reading stats** -- time and pages read today and this week (needs the `statistics` plugin).
- **Reading streak** -- your current and best reading streak, in days and weeks (needs the `statistics` plugin).
- **Random book** -- rolls an unread book from the current shelf (or your whole library) into the hero card; tap the dice for another.
- **Shelf count** -- how many books are on the current shelf.
- **Countdown** -- "N days until <your label>" for a date you pick; counts up ("N days since…") once the date has passed. Add it more than once for several dates, each with its own label.
- **Weather**, **On this day**, **Trivia**, **Daily fun** (jokes, facts and riddles) -- live content from the internet.
- **Action** -- a launcher card that runs a plugin, a KOReader action, or a Bookshelf action, with your own icon and an optional label.

Each module can carry its own settings (reached via **Module settings…** when you long-press it). Modules that need the internet show their data source in the picker rather than fetching while you browse. Modules are a small self-contained format: if you write a little Lua you can add your own by dropping a file into the plugin's `micromodules/` folder, or into `koreader/settings/bookshelf/micromodules/` to have it survive plugin updates. A bad one is skipped rather than breaking the menu. See `micromodules/README.md` for the contract.

---

## The book menu (long-press a cover)

Long-press any cover on the shelf or in the hero card -- or tap a book's **+N** tags pill -- to open the book detail popup, a tabbed window with everything about the book. The header shows a cover thumbnail, the title and author, and (when the book has bookmarks or highlights) a **N bookmarks ›** link in the top-right corner; tap it to open KOReader's bookmark browser for that book and jump into it. Along the bottom sit **Close**, two **zoom** buttons (magnifier icons) for text size, and **Open**.

There are five tabs:

- **Description** -- the book's blurb. When a Hardcover description is cached, a chip bar switches between the embedded and Hardcover text.
- **Reviews** -- spoiler-free Hardcover reviews for a linked book, cached so they reopen offline once fetched (see [Hardcover enrichment](#hardcover-enrichment)). Only shown for linked books.
- **Tags** -- **navigation pills** grouped into Author, Series, Collections, Genres, and Folder. Tap any pill to drill into that shelf; each section has an **Edit…** button for changing membership (this is where you add or remove the book from collections, edit genres, and so on).
- **Edit** -- the book's actions:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Unopened / Reading / On hold / Finished** | Reading status. Tap to change. Unopened clears progress and drops the book from Recent without touching highlights or bookmarks. |
| **Favourite** | Toggle the book in and out of Favourites. |
| **Your rating** | Set a 1-to-5 star rating, or clear it. |
| **Show info** | KOReader's built-in book info dialog. |
| **Refresh metadata** | Re-read the cover and metadata from the file (useful after editing metadata externally). |
| **Remove from history** | Drop the book from Recent without changing anything else on disk. |
| **Reset book data…** | A wider purge with checkboxes for progress, bookmarks, highlights, notes, custom cover, and custom metadata. |
| **Delete** | Permanently remove the file from disk (with a confirmation). |
| **Link… / Edit…** (Hardcover) | Shown only when `hardcoverapp.koplugin` is enabled. Link the book to a Hardcover edition, or edit an existing link. See [Hardcover enrichment](#hardcover-enrichment). |

If another plugin adds its own entries to KOReader's file long-press menu (for example "Open Incognito", or an AI assistant's "About this book"), those appear in the Edit tab too, so you can use them straight from Bookshelf.

- **Cover** (last tab) -- pick the book's cover from a paginated grid of candidates: covers already stored for the book, an image from your device (**Choose from device**), or an **online search** (Google Books, Open Library, and Hardcover for a linked book). Each candidate shows its source and resolution. Tap one to set it as the cover -- the shelf updates and the chosen image is saved as KOReader's standard custom cover, so its file browser shows it too. The book's own embedded cover appears in the grid as well, so you can revert by tapping it; a cover you'd set yourself is preserved.

**Text size.** The footer's **zoom** buttons resize the current tab's text, and each tab remembers its own size -- so you can enlarge a long Description or the Reviews without also inflating the Edit tab's buttons or the Tags pills. To resize the **tab labels** themselves (handy if Description/Reviews/Tags/Edit wrap onto a second row on a small screen), use **menu -> Text size -> Modal tabs**. (With Reviews present that's up to five tabs -- Description, Reviews, Tags, Edit, Cover -- so this helps most on a small screen.)

Long-pressing a series, author, genre, collection, format, rating, or folder stack instead opens a single **Pin to chip bar** prompt -- the fastest way to turn a stack you've drilled into into a permanent shelf.

---

## Collections

Collections are named lists of books, and Bookshelf uses KOReader's built-in collection system, so anything you collect in Bookshelf shows up in KOReader's collection menu (and vice versa). Two collections come ready:

- **Favourites** -- the built-in starred shelf. Always present; can't be renamed or deleted.
- **To Be Read** -- a reading pile for things you haven't started yet.

Open **menu -> Manage collections…** to add new collections, rename or delete existing ones, and **pin** any collection to your chip bar as a dedicated shelf.

To put a book into a collection, open its popup (long-press the cover), go to the **Tags** tab and tap **Edit…** in the Collections section. Tick the collections you want, then Save. The Collections pills update immediately to reflect what's changed.

---

## Hardcover enrichment

If you also use `hardcoverapp.koplugin`, Bookshelf can link books to Hardcover and cache a small amount of Hardcover metadata for display. Everything Hardcover follows that plugin's state: it all appears only while the plugin is installed and enabled, so it stays out of the way if you don't use Hardcover. Disable or remove the plugin and the **Hardcover enrichment** menu (in the bookshelf menu, below Manage collections) disappears and linked books revert to their own ratings, covers, metadata and descriptions. Nothing is lost -- the cached data stays on disk and comes back if you re-enable the plugin.

**Linking a book.** Open a book's popup (long-press its cover) and go to the **Edit** tab; with the plugin enabled, a Hardcover row sits below File & metadata. **Link…** (or **Edit…** once linked) opens the link menu:

- **Auto link** -- links without searching, using identifiers embedded in the EPUB (an ISBN, or a Hardcover id/edition baked into the file). The most specific identifier wins (a Hardcover edition, then ISBN, then a Hardcover book/slug). If the file carries no usable identifier, Auto link falls back to a best-guess search by title and author.
- **Manual link…** -- searches Hardcover by title and author and lets you pick the right book.
- **Select edition…** -- once linked, choose a specific edition (e.g. to get the right cover or page count).
- **Use Hardcover image** / **Use Hardcover description** -- per-book toggles (shown once linked) that override the book's own cover or description with Hardcover's. See below for how these are set automatically.
- **Clear link** -- remove the Hardcover link.

When a book is linked, its popup gains a **Reviews** tab (and the hero rating row's "N reviews" opens the popup straight to it). Reviews are filtered to spoiler-free ones, and cached, so they reopen offline once fetched.

**Linking the whole library at once.** **Hardcover enrichment -> Auto-link all books** links every unlinked book in one pass, fetching each match's details (description, cover, rating) as it goes. You pick how to match:

- **Exact match** -- uses an embedded ISBN or Hardcover id. Fast, and only links books that carry one.
- **Best guess** -- searches by title and author and picks the most confident match. Slower, but catches books with no embedded id.

It contacts Hardcover at about one book per second with cancellable progress, and shows a report at the end listing what was linked, what wasn't matched, and what had no identifier to try.

**Choosing covers and descriptions.** Each linked book has its own **Use Hardcover image** and **Use Hardcover description** toggles. When you link a book, Bookshelf sets sensible defaults once: it adopts the Hardcover description if the book has none of its own, and the Hardcover cover if the book has no embedded cover or its cover is lower resolution than Hardcover's. After that the per-book toggle is yours -- it's never changed again by a later refresh. Turning **Use Hardcover image** on saves the Hardcover cover into the book's sidecar (`.sdr`) folder as a custom cover, so KOReader's own file browser shows it too; turning it off restores whatever was there before -- a cover you'd set yourself is preserved, never overwritten.

**Ratings and metadata.** Two more options sit in the **Hardcover enrichment** menu:

- **Show Hardcover ratings in hero** -- the hero rating row shows the cached public Hardcover rating instead of KOReader's local one (and turns the rating row on).
- **Use Hardcover metadata** -- for linked books, shows Hardcover's title, author, series and genres in place of the book's own (a clean switch, no merging). This feeds sorting, search and series grouping for those books; non-linked books are untouched. **Hardcover genres used** caps how many of a book's genres become tag pills and genre stacks. Covers and descriptions stay under their per-book toggles. The metadata is always cached, so this only decides whether it's used.

**Managing the cache.** **Hardcover enrichment -> Manage Hardcover data** holds **Refresh ratings only**, **Clear cache (keeps links)**, and **Remove all Hardcover data** (unlinks everything and restores any covers Bookshelf installed).

Bookshelf does not rewrite EPUB files. Descriptions, ratings and the other cached metadata live in Bookshelf's own cache; a chosen Hardcover cover is stored as KOReader's standard custom cover in the book's `.sdr` folder. Network calls only happen from explicit actions (linking, refreshing ratings, fetching reviews); normal shelf rendering reads only the local cache.

---

## Layout

Open **menu -> Settings -> Edit shelf size…** for a live overlay that resizes the grid without leaving the home screen. Two controls:

- **Bookshelf size** -- how much room the shelves get relative to the hero card.
- **Book size** -- how large the covers render, which also sets how many fit per row.

The layout auto-fits your screen and orientation, so the same settings adapt between portrait and landscape. Changes preview in real time behind the overlay; **Accept** keeps them, **Cancel** reverts.

---

## Animations

On e-ink, Bookshelf can play a brief page-wipe animation on transitions so they read as motion rather than an abrupt refresh. Two independent settings under **menu -> Settings -> Advanced settings** control them:

- **Page turn animation** -- shelf page turns (the new page sweeps in from the side) and chip-bar paging (the chip row wipes across as you move between pages).
- **Start menu animation** -- the start menu reveals upward as it opens and wipes back down as it closes. It repaints a taller area than the page wipe and can look choppy on some panels, particularly while reading, so it's kept separate: keep one and turn the other off if you like.

Each is set to **Off**, **Fast**, **Medium**, or **Slow** on its own -- slower is smoother but takes a little longer on older panels. The effect is e-ink only: on LCD/OLED screens the refreshes complete instantly, so nothing is shown and the setting has no visible effect there.

A separate **Cover opening effect** toggle (same Advanced settings menu) briefly flexes a book's cover open as it launches. It's purely cosmetic and on by default; turn it off for an instant, plain open.

---

## Instant book close

Leaving a book drops you back to Bookshelf straight away, without waiting for the book to close. The actual close happens at the next quiet moment -- when you open another book, after about half a minute of inactivity, or when you leave Bookshelf -- so browsing never has to wait for it. Until then, going straight back into the same book is instant too.

This works however you leave a book: the reader's top-menu **File browser** button, a **File browser** gesture, or the quick menu.

It's on by default. Turn it off under **menu -> Settings -> Advanced settings -> Performance tweaks -> Instant book close** to close books fully before Bookshelf appears, as before. (Leaving a book you read in a different orientation to the shelf always closes fully, so the shelf returns to its own orientation.)

---

## Cover indicators

Each cover can show small badges and bars at the corners. Configure them under **menu -> Settings -> Cover display**:

- **Show reading bookmarks** -- a bookmark mark on books you're partway through.
- **Show completed book badge** -- a check-mark pill at the bottom-left of finished books.
- **Show progress bars** -- a thin progress bar above the bottom edge for in-progress books.
- **Show page count** -- a page-count pill in the bottom-right ("123 p"). (For EPUBs it works once you've opened the book at least once.)
- **Show series #** -- a "#3" badge on covers in a series. Tri-state: Always, Within series folder (so mixed shelves stay clean), or Never.

The colours of these elements are set separately under **Settings -> Colors** (see below).

The same **Cover display** menu also has **True cover aspect ratio**. Off by default, Bookshelf fits every cover to a uniform book rectangle; turn this on to show each cover at its real shape instead. Covers keep the same width but vary in height -- on the shelf they sit along the bottom shelf line, in the hero area they align to the top -- so wide or square covers stop being cropped or stretched.

---

## Colours

Open **menu -> Settings -> Colors** to recolour the cover chrome. Bookshelf keeps **independent day-mode and night-mode palettes** -- the top row of the menu shows which one you're editing ("Editing day-mode colours" / "Editing night-mode colours") and tapping it flips night mode so you can set each theme. Anything you leave unset uses a sensible default for that mode.

Each colour is chosen as a "% black on screen" value (so it reads the same way in both modes), and long-pressing a row resets just that colour. The pickers:

- **Progress bar** / **Progress bar track** -- the filled and unfilled parts of the cover progress bar.
- **Bookmark colour** / **Finished bookmark colour** -- the in-progress bookmark glyph and the finished-book check.
- **Favourite star colour** -- the star on favourited covers.
- **Badge foreground** / **Badge background** -- the text and fill of the "#N" series and "123 p" page-count pills.
- **Border colour** -- one shared colour for cover frames, badge borders, the bookmark/star halos, the cardboard edge on folder and stack cards, and placeholder (no-image) covers.
- **Folder overlay background** -- the cardboard fill behind folder and stack cards.
- **Folder text colour** -- the label text on those cards (the card outline follows Border colour).
- **Reset to default colours** -- restore the whole palette for the current mode.

---

## Custom images for folders and stacks

Bookshelf can replace the default folder cover (cardboard card with the first book peeking above) and the stack covers (Authors / Series / Genres / Collections) with your own images. Three ways to set one:

- **Long-press the card** -> *Set folder image…* / *Set author image…* / etc. -> pick an image file. The image renders as that folder's or stack's cover with the cardboard tab + label staying on top so the group identity is still visible.
- **Drop `cover.jpg`, `cover.png`, `folder.jpg`, or `folder.png` into a folder** and Bookshelf picks it up automatically. The hidden dot-file variants (`.cover.jpg`, `.cover.png`, `.folder.jpg`, `.folder.png`) work too, for keeping the image out of the visible file listing; a visible file wins if both are present. The image follows the folder when you move it.
- **Drop named images into an image library** for authors, series, genres, and collections. The default location is `<your-library>/.bookshelf-images/` with subfolders `authors/`, `series/`, `genres/`, and `collections/`. Name each file after the exact stack name (e.g. `authors/Asimov, Isaac.jpg`) or use a slugified form as a fallback. The slug lowercases the name and turns runs of punctuation / whitespace into single dashes, preserving the original order — so `Asimov, Isaac` matches `asimov-isaac.jpg`, and `Isaac Asimov` matches `isaac-asimov.jpg`. Extensions tried in order: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `bmp`, `webp`, `tiff`.

Pick a different image-library location under **menu -> Settings -> Advanced settings -> Image library**.

Long-press an image-set folder or stack and tap *Clear … image* to revert to the cardboard default.

---

## Author names

By default Bookshelf shows author names however each book stores them, so the same person can appear two ways (e.g. *Richard Osman* and *Osman, Richard*). Under **menu -> Settings -> Advanced settings -> Author name formatting** you can pick:

- **Auto** -- leave names as stored (the original behaviour; first form found wins).
- **First Last** -- always *Forename Surname*.
- **Last, First** -- always *Surname, Forename*.

Whichever you choose, variant spellings of the same author are merged into one entry on the Authors shelf, and the alpha-jump / surname sort uses the surname -- including names with particles like *de Maupassant*, which sort under **M**.

---

## Customising the hero card

Open **menu -> Edit book detail view** to toggle each of the eight sections on or off. The same menu has a **Font scale** entry at the top for resizing everything in the hero card at once (50-200%). Tap a section's row to open its **line editor**.

The **Tags** section is an interactive pill strip rather than a line of text, so instead of the line editor its row opens a small submenu: turn the line on or off, choose which pill categories to show (**Author**, **Series**, **Collections**, **Genres**, **Folder**), and set the **Font size** and **Alignment**. Turning off Author and Series, for instance, leaves a line of just the real tags. The **Rating** section is interactive too and is a simple on/off toggle.

The line editor lets you change the text and styling of one section. You'll see these controls:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Bold** | Toggle bold weight. |
| **Size** | A nudge dialog (-5 / -1 / +1 / +5) over the font size, range 8 to 48 pixels. |
| **Font** | Pick a font family. Shows previews when [Bookends](https://github.com/AndyHazz/bookends.koplugin) is installed. |
| **Aa / AA** | Toggle uppercase (hidden on the Description section). |
| **L / C / R** | Cycle alignment (left, centre, right). |
| **Bar style** | (Progress only) Cycle the inline progress bar's visual style. |
| **+ Bar / - Bar** | (Progress only) Add or remove the `%bar` placeholder. |
| **Bar height** | (Progress only) Nudge the inline bar's height as a percentage. |
| **Tokens…** | Pick from a categorised list of placeholders (see below). |
| **Icons…** | Insert icon glyphs from the built-in icon library (a searchable, categorised glyph grid). |
| **Default** | Reset this section's text and styling to its defaults. |
| **Cancel** | Revert and close. |
| **Save** | Persist and close. |

Edits update the hero card behind the editor in real time.

### Tokens (placeholders)

Any text in a hero section can include **tokens** -- placeholders that get replaced with live data. For example, `%title` becomes the book title; `%book_pct` becomes the percentage read.

You can wrap things in `[if:...]...[/if]` to show them only when the relevant data exists. For instance, `[if:series]%series_name #%series_num[/if]` only renders when the book is in a series.

The full token list is in the [Token cheatsheet](#token-cheatsheet) below.

## Bundled fonts

Bookshelf ships three open-licensed fonts (see `fonts/CREDITS.md`):

- **Roboto Condensed** (Apache 2.0) -- the default Bookshelf UI font on new installs.
- **Inter ExtraBold** (OFL) -- default hero title.
- **Caveat** (OFL) -- default hero author.

Set the interface font under **Bookshelf settings -> Bookshelf UI font** (defaults to
*Follow KOReader UI font* for existing users). The fonts are also copied into your font
folder so they're selectable in the hero card's font picker after a restart. Existing
users can adopt the new detail look via **Reset book detail area to defaults**.

---

## Updates

Open **menu -> Updates** to keep Bookshelf current:

- **Notify on wake when update available** -- opt-in. Once an hour after a Wi-Fi-connected wake, Bookshelf checks the GitHub releases page and posts a quiet notification if a new version is out. Off by default; nothing is ever fetched without your permission.
- **Installed version / Update available** -- the current installed version. When a newer release exists, tap the row to read the release notes and choose **Update and restart**.
- **Developer updates** (advanced) -- type a development branch name (e.g. `feat/foo`) to install the tip of that branch. Use **Reset to latest stable release** to clear the dev branch and pull the latest published release.

The whole download, unpack, and restart sequence runs over Wi-Fi only and needs no extra plugins.

---

## Library refresh

After adding new books over USB, Calibre, Syncthing, or KOReader's network downloads:

- **Automatically** -- Bookshelf watches your library folder in the background and picks up newly added books on its own, with no interaction needed.
- **Tap a chip** -- it also checks for filesystem changes on chip taps.
- **Swipe down** on the shelf area for an immediate, full refresh; a brief "Refreshing library" notice appears.

<summary><strong>Chip sources, filters, and sorts</strong></summary>

#### Sources

Each chip points at one of:

- **Home (folders)** -- your library as a folder tree.
- **Home (flat)** -- every book in one list, no folders.
- **Recent** -- books you've opened, newest-read first.
- **Latest added** -- new files on disk, newest-added first (scan depth set under Advanced settings -> "Latest" walk depth).
- **Favourites**
- **Series**, **Authors**, **Genres**, **Collections**, **Formats**, **Ratings**, **Languages** -- a stack of all the values; drill into one to see its books.
- **Specific** series / author / genre / collection / format / rating / language / folder / reading status -- a shelf scoped to a single chosen value.
- **Folder (flattened)** -- a single folder shown as every book beneath it in one list, no sub-folder cards (vs. the plain folder source, which keeps the sub-folder tree).

#### Filters

Each chip can narrow its shelf with any combination of filters, set from **Filters…** in the chip editor:

- **Reading status** -- Unread, Reading, On hold, Finished.
- **Genre**, **Language**, **Format**, **Collection** -- pick any number of values.
- **Rating** -- one to five stars, or Unrated.
- **Folder** -- include and/or exclude folders (an exclude wins over an include, and both apply to sub-folders).

Picks within one filter match *any* of them, so two chosen genres show books in either. Picks across different filters must *all* match, so adding a 5-star rating then limits those to 5-star books only. Each choice shows how many books currently match given the other selected filters. All filters are off by default (everything visible).

#### Sort priority

Up to three levels per chip. Available sort keys:

- **Title**, **Filename**
- **Author surname**, **Author (given name)**
- **Series name**, **Series index**, **Series + index** (series name then number, in one pick)
- **Last opened** (most-recent-first by default)
- **Date added** (most-recent-first by default)
- **Percent read** (most progress first by default)
- **Rating** (highest first by default; unrated last)
- **Unread/Reading/Finished** or **Reading/Unread/Finished** (status orderings)
- **File size**
- **Page count**
- **Book count** (for stacks)

Defaults adjust to the source (e.g. Recent defaults to *Last opened*; Latest added defaults to *Date added*). The first-level sort decides the order of stacks for grouped sources; subsequent levels order books within each stack.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Hero card line editor</strong></summary>

The book detail card has **eight editable sections**: Status, Rating, Title, Author, Metadata, Description, Tags (interactive), and Progress. The Tags section shows tappable pills rather than a text template, so it has no line editor; toggle it on or off like the others.

Open **menu -> Edit book detail view** to toggle each section on or off. Tap a section's row (when its toggle is on) to open the **line editor**.

Edits live-update the hero behind the editor on every keystroke; only the right column of the card is rebuilt, so the cover stays untouched.

#### Editor buttons

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Bold** | Toggle bold weight |
| **Size** | -5 / -1 / +1 / +5 nudge over the font size (range 8-48 px) |
| **Font** | Font family picker |
| **Aa / AA** | Case toggle (hidden on Description) |
| **L / C / R** | Alignment cycle (left / centre / right) |
| **Bar style** | (Progress only) Cycle inline progress-bar styles |
| **+ Bar / - Bar** | (Progress only) Insert or remove the `%bar` token in the template |
| **Bar height** | (Progress only) Nudge the inline bar's height (% of text height) |
| **Tokens…** | Categorised token catalogue with live preview |
| **Icons…** | Insert icon glyphs from the built-in icon library (searchable glyph grid) |
| **Default** | Reset this section's template and styling to defaults |
| **Cancel** | Revert and close |
| **Save** | Persist and close |

#### Bookends extras

Several editor surfaces use the [Bookends](https://github.com/AndyHazz/bookends.koplugin) plugin when it's installed. Everything degrades gracefully when it isn't:

| Surface | With Bookends | Without |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Token picker | Modal with chips, search, live preview | Plain Menu over the token catalogue |
| Font picker | Each family rendered in its own typeface, weight variants deduped | Plain Menu over the system font list |
| Progress-bar styles | 7 styles (`bordered`, `solid`, `rounded`, `metro`, `wavy`, `radial`, `radial_hollow`) | 2 styles (`bordered`, `solid`) |

The icon picker is built in and needs no extra plugins.

</details>

<a id="token-cheatsheet"></a>
<details>
<summary><strong>Token cheatsheet</strong></summary>

Tokens are placeholders prefixed with `%`. Conditional logic uses `[if:cond]…[/if]` (with optional `[else]`).

#### Book metadata

| Token | Example |
|-------|---------|
| `%title` | *The Great Gatsby* |
| `%author` | *F. Scott Fitzgerald* (first author) |
| `%author_2` / `%author_3` | second / third author (empty if absent) |
| `%authors` | *Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett* (all authors) |
| `%author_count` | *2* (number of authors) |
| `%authors_short` | first author, or *A and B*, or *A, B, et al.* for three or more |
| `%series` / `%series_name` | *Dune* |
| `%series_num` | *1* |
| `%rating` | *★★★☆☆* (empty when unrated) |
| `%rating_number` | *3* (1-5, empty when unrated) |
| `%hardcover_rating` | *4.5* (cached Hardcover rating, empty when unavailable) |
| `%hardcover_stars` | Cached Hardcover rating as star glyphs |
| `%status` | *reading* (unread / reading / on_hold / finished) |
| `%filename` | *The_Great_Gatsby* |
| `%format` | *EPUB* |
| `%lang` | *en* |
| `%description` | Book blurb (HTML stripped, entities decoded) |
| `%quote` | A random highlight from this book, in quotation marks (a fresh one each time you select the book; empty if the book has no highlights). Handy in the Description section in place of the blurb. |
| `%quote_source` | The book and author for `%quote` |

#### Position and progress

| Token | Example |
|-------|---------|
| `%page_num` / `%page_count` | *42* / *218* |
| `%pages_left` | *176* |
| `%book_pct` / `%book_pct_left` | *19%* / *81%* |
| `%bar` | Inline progress-bar widget (Progress section only) |
| `%spacer` | Elastic gap that pushes content left/right. `Reading%spacer47%` renders *Reading* on the left and *47%* on the right. |

#### Statistics (requires the `statistics` plugin)

| Token | Example |
|-------|---------|
| `%book_time_left` | *3h 45m* |
| `%book_read_time` | *2h 30m* |
| `%book_pages_read` | *142* |
| `%days_reading_book` | *7* |
| `%pages_per_day` | *12* |
| `%speed` | *42* (pages per hour) |

Statistics tokens auto-hide when the plugin is absent or the book has no recorded reading time.

#### Time and date

| Token | Example |
|-------|---------|
| `%time` / `%time_24h` | *14:35* |
| `%time_12h` | *2:35 pm* |
| `%date` / `%date_long` / `%date_numeric` | *3 May* / *3 May 2026* / *03/05/2026* |
| `%weekday` / `%weekday_short` | *Monday* / *Mon* |
| `%datetime{%H:%M}` | Custom `os.date` format |

#### Device

| Token | Example |
|-------|---------|
| `%batt` / `%batt_icon` | *73%* / charge-aware glyph |
| `%wifi_icon` | Wi-Fi icon (connected / disconnected) |
| `%light` / `%light_pct` / `%light_icon` | *18* / *75%* / lightbulb glyph |
| `%warmth` | Frontlight warmth (natural-light only) |
| `%nightmode` | Moon glyph when night mode is on, sun otherwise |
| `%mem` / `%ram` | System memory (%) / KOReader RSS (MiB) |
| `%disk` | Free space on the books partition (GB) |

#### Conditionals

```
[if:book_time_left]%book_time_left LEFT[else]Open to start reading[/if]
[if:lang!=en]Lang: %lang\n[/if]%description
[if:batt<20]LOW BATTERY %batt[/if]
[if:not series]Standalone[/if]
[if:connected]%wifi_icon[/if]
%time_12h[if:full_width]   ·   %date[/if]
```

Comparisons: `=` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=`. Boolean: `and`, `or`, `not`. Numeric tokens compare numerically; string tokens compare by string equality. The `connected` condition is true only while actually online, so `[if:connected]%wifi_icon[/if]` shows the Wi-Fi glyph just when connected. The `full_width` condition is true only in the wide status line of the micro-module and full-screen views (not the narrow cover-view status), so you can surface extra content -- a date, say -- only where there's room for it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Settings file (advanced)</strong></summary>

Bookshelf stores its settings in a dedicated file alongside KOReader's other plugin data, separate from `settings.reader.lua`:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Linux / dev | `~/.config/koreader/settings/bookshelf.lua` |
| Kindle | `/mnt/us/koreader/settings/bookshelf.lua` |
| Kobo | `/mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/settings/bookshelf.lua` |
| Android | `<koreader-dir>/settings/bookshelf.lua` |

Existing v1 settings migrate automatically on first launch -- legacy keys are read from `settings.reader.lua`, copied across with the `bookshelf_` prefix stripped, and removed from the global file.

#### Selected keys

| Key | Shape |
|-----|-------|
| `tabs` | Ordered list of chip records (id, label, icon, source, filter, sort_priority, enabled). |
| `hero_regions` | Per-section overrides (sparse). One entry per section (status / rating / title / author / metadata / description / tags / progress) with any subset of template, font_face, font_size, bold, uppercase, alignment, disabled, bar_style, bar_height. The interactive **tags** section also takes per-category toggles (show_author / show_series / show_collections / show_genres / show_folder) plus font_size and alignment. |
| `font_scale` | Global zoom for hero text (50-200%). |
| `chip_font_scale` | Chip bar font size (50-300%). |
| `chip_flex_widths` | Boolean. When true, longer-labelled chips get more horizontal space than icon-only ones. |
| `active_chip` / `active_page` / `drill_path` | Persisted navigation state, restored on KOReader restart. |
| `progress_bar_enabled` / `progress_bookmark_enabled` / `progress_badge_enabled` / `progress_page_count_enabled` | Cover indicator toggles. |
| `show_series_num` | "always" / "in_series" / "never". |
| `progress_fill` / `progress_track` / `bookmark_color` / `complete_bookmark_color` / `favorite_star_color` / `badge_fg` / `badge_bg` / `border_color` / `folder_overlay_bg` / `folder_overlay_fg` | Cover-chrome colours (% black). Each also has a `_night` variant for the night-mode palette; unset keys fall back to per-mode defaults. |
| `author_format` | `"auto"` / `"first_last"` / `"last_first"` -- author name display. |
| `bookshelf_ui_font` | Chosen Bookshelf interface font (a resolvable font face). Absent = follow KOReader's UI font. |
| `cover_cache_mb` | Memory budget (MB) for the scaled-cover cache (default 24). The legacy `cover_cache_size` count key is discarded on first load. |
| `hardcover_links` / `hardcover_enrichment` / `hardcover_ratings` / `hardcover_reviews` | Optional Hardcover link and cached description/cover/rating/review metadata used by the Hardcover enrichment menu. |
| `hardcover_hero_rating` | Show cached Hardcover ratings in the hero rating row instead of KOReader's local rating. |
| `hardcover_use_metadata` | Use Hardcover's title/author/series/genres for linked books in place of their own. |
| `hardcover_max_genres` | How many of a linked book's Hardcover genres to use (when `hardcover_use_metadata` is on). |
| `calibre_metadata` | BETA. Read metadata from `metadata.calibre` if present. |
| `latest_walk_depth` | How deep the **Latest** source scans your library. |
| `show_close_msg` | Show the centred "Closing book…" toast when exiting a book. |
| `hot_park` | Instant book close: leave the book open in the background and finish closing it at the next quiet moment. Default on. |
| `open_cover_effect` | Play the cover-opening flex when launching a book. Default on. |
| `shelf_page_animation` / `start_menu_animation` | Wipe-animation speed (`off` / `fast` / `medium` / `slow`) for shelf/chip paging and for the start menu, set independently. E-ink only. |
| `true_cover_aspect` | Render covers at their real shape instead of a uniform rectangle. Default off. |
| `dev_branch` / `last_install_source` / `check_updates` | Updater state. |
| `start_menu_items` | The start menu tree: an ordered list of entries (actions, plugin launchers, folders with children, and micro-modules). |
| `start_menu_position` | `"left"` / `"right"` / `"off"` -- where the start-menu button sits in the footer. |
| `start_menu_seeded` / `start_menu_next_id` | One-shot seed flag for the default menu, and the counter behind generated entry ids. |
| `micromodule_<key>_*` | Per-micro-module settings (e.g. `micromodule_clock_format`, `micromodule_random_unread_source`). Each module owns its own keys. |
| `migrated` | One-shot flag; presence indicates v1 -> v2 migration has run. |

<details>
<summary><strong>Known limitations</strong></summary>

- **`%bar` styling lives in the Progress section.** Inserting `%bar` in another section still renders the widget, but uses the bordered default style and 100% height since the Bar style / Bar height buttons only appear in the Progress section's editor.
- **Italic** is reachable only via the font picker (by selecting an italic family). The line editor has no italic toggle because `TextBoxWidget` doesn't synthesise italic from upright fonts.
- **Inline format tags** `[b]`, `[i]`, `[u]` in templates are stripped before display. Use the per-section Bold button instead.
- **Page count for EPUBs** requires opening the book at least once. The count comes from KOReader's pagemap or reading statistics, both of which are populated only after the first paginate.
