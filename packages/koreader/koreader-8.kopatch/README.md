# KOReader Mosaic Patches

A curated set of [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/) user patches for the default KOReader CoverBrowser plugin mosaic file-browser view. This project consolidates 13+ community patches into 3 unified Lua scripts. 

It is based on the work of several KOReader community contributors with bug fixes, performance improvement, a unified configuration surface, new features and aesthetic adjustments.

## Patches

### Visual Overhaul (`2--visual-overhaul.lua`)

Consolidated patch that replaces the default mosaic cover appearance. Merges the former standalone patches for stretched covers, rounded corners, folder covers, overlay badges, and automatic series grouping into a single file.

#### Cover rendering

Stretched covers with aspect ratio control . Set `fill = true` to ignore the ratio and fill the entire cell. Rounded corners are drawn via four SVG overlays . A thin border  frames every cover. Results are memoised in an cache (2000 entries) to avoid redundant rebuilds during scrolling. 

Sidecar cover images (image files (jpg/jpeg/png/webp/gif) sitting next to a book file with the same basename (e.g. `book.jpg` next to `book.epub`) ) are automatically used as the book's cover and hidden from the file listing.

#### Folder covers

Folders display a cover image sourced from `.cover.{jpg,jpeg,png,webp,gif}` inside the folder. If no `.cover` file exists, the first book with a cached cover is used instead. A capitalized folder name is rendered centered over the cover (toggleable via the settings menu). A file-count badge (rounded pill) appears in the bottom-right corner.

#### Title strip

The title strip below each cover shows the book title. When both `series` and `authors` metadata are present, the strip renders series info and author on two lines beneath the title. Folder title strips for series groups show the author name instead of a book count.

#### Overlay badges

- **Progress bar** -- bottom of cover, inside border. Rounded horizontal bar; fill colour changes to grey for abandoned/paused books. Hidden below 2% and treated as complete above 97%.
- **Percent badge** -- top-right corner. Icon with percentage text (e.g. "42%") overlaid. Shown when a book is in progress.
- **Pages badge** -- bottom-left corner. Page count from metadata or filename pattern `P(123)` displayed as a "123 p." pill. Shown for unread books.
- **Series badge** -- top-middle area. Small rounded rectangle showing "#N" (e.g. "#3"). Shown when `series` and `series_index` metadata are present.
- **"NEW" badge** -- top-left corner. Shown for books added within a configurable number of days (default 30).
- **Status dogear** -- bottom-right corner (Reading, Completed, On-Hold)

</p>

#### Automatic series grouping

When enabled (toggle: "Group book series into folders" in file browser settings), books sharing the same `series` metadata field (`calibre:series` / `belongs-to-collection`) are collapsed into a virtual folder. Tapping a series folder opens a sub-view sorted by `series_index`. Series metadata is extracted in the background. If every book in a directory belongs to the same series, grouping is skipped. Series containing only one book are not grouped.

### Runtime feature toggles

All 13 visual features can be toggled at runtime without editing Lua.

**Menu path:** *File browser > Mosaic and detailed list settings > Visual features*

| Toggle | Default | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Stretched covers (aspect ratio) | On | Full refresh on toggle |
| Rounded corner overlays | On | |
| Folder cover images | On | Full refresh |
| Stacked bars above folders | On | |
| Title strip below covers | On | Full refresh |
| Reading progress bar | On | |
| Percent read badge | On | |
| Page count badge | On | |
| Series index badge | On | Full refresh |
| Status dogear icons | On | |
| New book badge | On | |
| Image file as book cover | On | Full refresh |
| Group series into virtual folders | On | Full refresh |
| Wallpaper-compatible mode | Off | Full refresh |

Two additional folder-name settings are injected directly into "Mosaic and detailed list settings":
- **Folder name centered** (default: on)
- **Show folder name** (default: on)

Toggles are persisted via `BookInfoManager` (stored as `feat_<key>` = "Y"/"N"). Items marked "Full refresh" trigger `refreshPath()` (re-reads directory); others trigger the lighter `updateItems()`.

### Disable CoverBrowser Widgets (`2--disable-all-CB-widgets.lua`)

**Deprecated -- optional.** The visual overhaul patch (`2--visual-overhaul.lua`) now suppresses stock CoverBrowser overlay widgets internally before rendering its own replacements. This standalone patch is no longer required. It is harmless if still installed but can be safely removed.

### Double-Tap to Open (`2-browser-double-tap.lua`)

Requires a double-tap to open books in the file browser, preventing accidental opens. The timeout is configurable from 200 to 1000 ms (default 500 ms) via the "Double-tap to open books" submenu under File manager settings. Folders, "go up" entries, and file-selection mode are not affected -- they respond to a single tap as usual.

## Installation

⚠ For those running KOReader on Android, please use the releases provided on the [KOReader Github](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/releases). FDroid releases doesn't support user patches.

### On device

1. Copy all the `.lua` files to `koreader/patches/` on your e-reader.
2. Copy the SVG icons to the appropriate `koreader/icons/` subdirectory:

| Directory | Files | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `icons/all/` | `rounded.corner.{tl,tr,bl,br}.svg`, `percent.badge.svg`, `dogear.{reading,complete,abandoned}.svg` | Shared icons |
| `icons/icons-colours/` | Same set | Color device variants |
| `icons/icons-bw/` | Same set | BW / e-ink variants |

3. Restart KOReader.

It is recommanded to run ![image-20260301185701808](README.assets/image-20260301185701808.png) > Extract and cache book information > Here and Under > Refresh > Prune for the first run.

This allow proper series detection.

### Patch load order

KOReader loads patches in lexicographic order. The `2--` prefix (double dash) sorts before `2-` (single dash). All patches share the `2` prefix so they load in the same priority tier after any `1-` patches. The `2--disable-all-CB-widgets.lua` patch is no longer a prerequisite but is harmless if present.

For the official guide on user patches, see: <https://koreader.rocks/user_guide/#L2-userpatches>

## Recommended KOReader Settings

### Mosaic grid: 3x2

*Swipe down for upper menu > File browser  (![image-20260301200016130](README.assets/image-20260301200016130.png) /![image-20260301184259694](README.assets/image-20260301184259694.png)) > Display mode > Mosaic with cover images.*  Also Toggle here: *Use this mode everywhere*

*Swipe down for upper menu > File browser  (![image-20260301200020354](README.assets/image-20260301200020354.png) / ![image-20260301184259694](README.assets/image-20260301184259694.png)) > Settings > Mosaic and detailed list settings > Items per page: set to a 3-column, 2-row grid.* 

This is the layout the default badge sizes and font constants are tuned for.

### Hide "go up" folder

The `../` navigation item takes one cover slot in mosaic view. Remove it by setting and locking a home folder:

*Swipe down for upper menu > File browser  (![image-20260301200028523](README.assets/image-20260301200028523.png) / ![image-20260301184259694](README.assets/image-20260301184259694.png)) > Settings > Home folder settings:*

1. **Set home folder** (e.g. `/mnt/onboard/Books`)
2. **Shorten home folder**
3. **Lock home folder**; locking the folder removes the "up directory" tile entirely.

![image-20260301184602925](README.assets/image-20260301184602925.png)

### Series metadata display

*File browser settings > Mosaic and detailed list settings > Series metadata*: ensure this is enabled so the series badge and automatic series grouping have access to `series` / `series_index` fields.

*Swipe down for upper menu > File browser  (![image-20260301200034159](README.assets/image-20260301200034159.png) / ![image-20260301184259694](README.assets/image-20260301184259694.png)) > Settings > Mosaic and detailed list settings > Series > Show series metadata in separate line*

## Credits

This patch set builds on the work of several KOReader community contributors.

### SeriousHornet

<https://github.com/SeriousHornet/KOReader.patches>

The visual overhaul consolidates thirteen patches from the "Visual Overhaul Suite" (VOS): rounded covers, stretched covers, folder covers, status icons, pages badge, percent badge, series indicator, series badge, progress bar, collections star, faded finished books, and the disable-widgets prerequisites. Bug fixes and aesthetic constants were adjusted during the merge.

> SeriousHornet credits @joshuacant, @sebdelsol, and u/medinauta for code and structural contributions to the original patches.

### sparklerfish

<https://github.com/sparklerfish/KOReader.patches>

The double-tap-to-open patch originates from this repository, adopted with adjustments for CoverBrowser compatibility and settings persistence.

### koboprincess

<https://github.com/koboprincess/KOReader-Patches-/>

Ideas for progress-bar and percent-badge trigger thresholds and the stacked folder cover approach were drawn from this fork of SeriousHornet's work.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- A KOReader build from source -- see [Building.md](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/blob/master/doc/Building.md)
- The `kodev` script produced by that build
- This repo cloned with path access to the emulator build directory

### Environment setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the three variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `KODEV` | Path to the `kodev` script | `/path/to/koreader/kodev` |
| `LIBRARY` | Path to a test library of EPUB/PDF files | `/path/to/KOReader.patches/Library` |
| `EMULATOR_PATCHES` | Path where the emulator symlink will be created (pointing back to this repo's `patches/`) | `/path/to/koreader-emulator/koreader/patches` |
| `SIMULATE` | Device preset for the emulator screen size (default: `kobo-libra-2`) | `kobo-libra-2`, `kindle`, `custom` |

### Makefile targets

| Target | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `help` | `make` or `make help` | Show available targets |
| `run` | `make run` | Symlink patches/icons and run emulator (`SIMULATE=<device>` to change screen) |
| `run-bw` | `make run-bw` | Symlink patches/icons and run emulator in grayscale (`SIMULATE=<device>`) |
| `link-patches` | `make link-patches` | Symlink emulator patches dir to this repo's `patches/` |
| `link-icons` | `make link-icons` | Symlink emulator icons dir to this repo's `icons/` |
| `devices` | `make devices` | List available device presets for `SIMULATE=` |
| `reset` | `make reset` | Remove all KOReader state from the emulator |

Both `KODEV` and `LIBRARY` must be set for `run` and `run-bw`. Set `SIMULATE=<device>` to change the emulator screen size (run `make devices` to see available presets). The grayscale target sets `EMULATE_BW_SCREEN=1` and `EMULATE_BB_TYPE=BB8` for true BW simulation.0
