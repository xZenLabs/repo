# StoryGraph for KOReader

A KOReader plugin to synchronize your reading progress, notes, and status to [The StoryGraph](https://thestorygraph.com).

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is a fork of the [Hardcover.app for KOReader](https://github.com/Billiam/hardcoverapp.koplugin) by [Billiam](https://github.com/Billiam). It has been redesigned to support StoryGraph.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Disclaimer**: This plugin uses an unofficial API based on session cookies. Because of this, it is inherently brittle and may break if StoryGraph updates their website or cookie structure. If sync stops working, please ensure you are using the latest version of the plugin and try re-fetching your session tokens.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release and extract it to your KOReader `plugins/` folder.
2. Rename `storygraph_config.example.lua` to `storygraph_config.lua`.
   - *Note: If you are upgrading from an older version, the plugin will automatically rename `hardcover_config.lua` to `storygraph_config.lua`.*
3. **Authentication**:
   - Log in to [thestorygraph.com](https://thestorygraph.com) in your browser.
   - Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) -> Application/Storage -> Cookies.
   - Copy the value of the `_story_graph_session` cookie and paste it into the `session_cookie` field in `storygraph_config.lua`.
   - Copy the value of the `remember_user_token` cookie and paste it into the `remember_user_token` field in `storygraph_config.lua`.

## Usage

The StoryGraph menu is located in the **Bookmark** top menu when a document is active.

### Updating Progress & Notes
The plugin provides a unified **"Update progress: [XX]%"** menu item. This opens a powerful dialog where you can:
- **Set Progress**: Tap the progress button to open a native picker showing both your **KOReader** and **StoryGraph** synced percentages.
- **Add a Note**: Write your thoughts directly in the note field.
- **Location Context**: By default, notes sent via the highlight menu automatically include your current **Chapter, Page, and Percentage**. You can enable this for regular notes in the settings.

### Linking a Book
Before updates can be sent, the plugin needs to link your document to a StoryGraph book.
- Use **"Link book"** to search by metadata or ISBN.
- Use **"Change edition"** to switch to a different edition.
- Audio editions are filtered out of the search results.
- If a book is not currently tracked, the plugin will set its status to Currently Reading
- If another edition of the book is set as 'Currently Reading' or 'Want to Read' then the plugin will automatically link to that edition, but not change the status. You can use "Change edition" to link to a different edition if needed.

### Automatically Track Progress
When enabled, the plugin will periodically sync your progress to StoryGraph:
- Updates are sent when paging, no more than once per minute (configurable).
- When reaching the end of the document, the book is automatically marked as "Read" on StoryGraph.
- Progress can be synced automatically based on time duration, percentage read or pages read (based on edition page count).

## Settings

- **Include location info in regular notes**: Automatically append Chapter, Page, and % info to your regular notes.
- **Automatically link by ISBN/Title**: Attempt to find matching books on StoryGraph automatically when opening a new document.
- **Enable wifi on demand**: Briefly enable wifi for background syncs to preserve battery life.
- **Confirm changes**: Prompt for confirmation before changing a book's status (e.g., Want to Read -> Read).

## Versioning & Mandatory Updates

To prevent data corruption and ensure compatibility with StoryGraph's unofficial API, the plugin includes a remote versioning system.

- **Automatic Checks**: The plugin periodically checks for mandatory updates via GitHub. If the StoryGraph API changes in a way that breaks older versions, the plugin will automatically disable sync to prevent errors.
- **Blocking**: When a mandatory update is required, the plugin menus will be greyed out.
- **Configurable Frequency**: Use the **"Version check frequency"** slider to choose how often the plugin checks for updates (from 1 to 20 days). Default is 1 day.
- **Manual Override**: You can enable **"Ignore version blocks"** to bypass mandatory update requirements. Use this with caution as older versions may break sync if the StoryGraph API changes.
- **Silent Mode**: Disable **"Show version alert dialog"** if you prefer the plugin to silently stop working when an update is required, rather than showing a notification.
