**Cross-device reading progress, annotations, metadata, and render-settings sync for KOReader.**

Syncery synchronises per-device reading data across all your KOReader devices — via Syncthing or cloud storage (Dropbox/WebDAV/FTP).

**New here?** Start with the **[Setup &amp; Sync Guide](SETUP.md)** — how to set up Syncthing or cloud sync from scratch.

## Features

Syncery keeps your reading life in step across every KOReader device — self-hosted, with no account and no third-party server in the middle.

- **Reading position** — start a book on one device and pick up exactly where you left off on another. When a device is further ahead, Syncery offers to jump you there — your choice of automatic, ask first, or never.
- **Highlights, notes & bookmarks** — your annotations follow you everywhere. Deleted ones go to a **Trash Bin** you can restore from.
- **Book details** — reading status (Reading / On hold / Finished), star rating, collections, your summary note, a custom title or author, and a handmade table of contents all stay in sync.
- **Font & layout** — optionally sync per-book font and margins too. Off by default, since a size that's comfortable on a phone is wrong on a large e-reader.
- **Your files, your transport** — everything travels as plain JSON over **Syncthing** (direct device-to-device) or your own **cloud** (Dropbox / WebDAV / FTP). 
- **Nothing lost when devices disagree** — edits made on different devices merge instead of overwriting each other. The one case that can truly clash — marking a book *Finished* on one device and *On hold* on another — is surfaced for you to resolve, never dropped silently.
- **Works offline** — changes sync whenever your devices next reconnect; a device that's been offline for weeks keeps its place.
- **Whole-library Sync Now** — one tap pushes and pulls every book with a pending change, not just the one you have open, and discovers books your other devices have synced that you've never opened here — their progress and annotations are prefetched, so they're ready the moment you do.
- **Reading statistics & vocabulary** — automatically trigger KOReader's built-in Statistics and Vocabulary Builder plugins to sync their databases over your cloud storage, using the same periodic schedule. Syncery triggers the sync; the plugins handle the merge themselves.
- **See everything in one place** — a **Progress Browser** shows how far each device has read in every book (and jumps you to any of them), and an **Annotation Browser** gathers all your highlights and notes across your whole library.

For the exact fields and toggles, see [What Syncery syncs](#what-syncery-syncs); for how it's built, see [Architecture overview](#architecture-overview).

## Supported devices

Any device that runs a reasonably recent version of KOReader

Syncery writes JSON files to disk — it does not manage its own daemon.
Data replication is handled by the transport (Syncthing or Cloud), so any
device that can run KOReader and one of those transports can participate.

---

## Installation

### Manual ZIP

1. Download the latest `syncery.koplugin.zip` from [Releases](../../releases).
2. Extract `syncery.koplugin/` into your KOReader plugins directory:

   | Device | Plugins directory |
   |--------|-------------------|
   | Kobo | `/mnt/onboard/.adds/koreader/plugins/` |
   | Kindle | `/mnt/us/koreader/plugins/` |
   | Android | `/koreader/plugins/` |

3. Restart KOReader. The plugin appears as **Syncery** in **☰ → Tools**.

### Updating

Open **Syncery → Check for plugin
updates**. It checks GitHub for a newer release, shows the
notes, installs it in place, and offers to restart.

### Dependencies

The plugin itself has no runtime dependencies beyond KOReader. Each transport
needs its backend:

- **Syncthing** — a running Syncthing daemon with REST API access
  (via the KOSyncthing+ plugin, another Syncthing plugin and Android app for Android devices).
- **Cloud** — KOReader's "Cloud storage+"
  plugin with a configured service (Dropbox/WebDAV/FTP).

---

## First-time setup

The first-run wizard (triggers automatically on first load) walks through up
to 5 steps in a single centred panel:

### 1 - Choose a transport

Pick how this device will sync: **Syncthing** (peer-to-peer), **Cloud** (request-response, Dropbox/WebDAV/FTP), or **Decide
later** (save your data locally now and pick a transport afterwards). If
KOSyncthing+ is installed, the Syncthing row offers auto-discovery.

### 2 - Enter API key (Syncthing only)

If you chose Syncthing *without* KOSyncthing+, an `InputDialog` asks for the
Syncthing REST API key. This step is skipped otherwise.

### 3 - Choose what to sync

Toggle **progress** and **annotations**. Both are off by default — consent-first, so nothing syncs until you turn it on. (Finer
controls — metadata, render settings, annotation sub-toggles — live in the menu
under *What's synced* after setup.)

### 4 - Name this device

Set a human-readable label that other devices will see (e.g. "Kindle
Paperwhite"). Shown in the status panel and in every merge record.

### 5 - Review and confirm

A recap step shows all choices. Tap **Done** to save and start syncing.

## Storage modes

> **SDR (default)**
> *Write:* `<book>.sdr/<book>.syncery-annotations.json`
> *Rule:* follows KOReader's "Book metadata location" (the book's sidecar directory)
> *Read:* canonical location, with a fallback across KOReader's three metadata locations (book folder / docsettings / hashdocsettings)
> *Best for:* users who want Syncery to follow their existing KOReader setup
>
> **Synceryhash**
> *Write:* `<settings>/syncery/synceryhash/<shard>/<book_md5>/syncery-annotations.json`
> *Rule:* content-addressed (same book = same path on every device)
> *Read:* single location (no fallback needed)
> *Best for:* users who want a known, separate location to sync
>
> **Don't confuse the two "hash" ideas:** *Synceryhash* is where Syncery keeps **its own** files. KOReader's **hashdocsettings** is a separate setting — one of the three places KOReader keeps **its** native `.sdr`, and just one of the locations the SDR mode above follows. You don't need hashdocsettings to use Synceryhash.
>
> **Both modes share (private, never synced):**
> * `last_sync/<book_md5>/` — the per-device ancestor used for 3-way merge
> * `cloud_staging/` — upload staging
> * `sync-journal.ndjson` — merge event log
> * `syncery_activity.json` — recent-activity record
>
> **Migration:** run-once, idempotent, moves shared files only. Advanced → Storage mode.

## What Syncery syncs

| Category | What gets saved | Merge strategy | UI toggles |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Reading progress** | Per-device: `(percent, page, total_pages, xpath, revision, timestamp, device_id)` | Last-write-wins by `(revision, timestamp)` | Master toggle |
| **Annotations** | Highlights, notes, bookmarks — each with colour, drawer, timestamps, device_id | 3-way merge with tombstone tracking | Master toggle + highlights/notes/bookmarks sub-toggles (each filters its own type; a disabled type stays local and is preserved for other devices in the shared file) + file-extension filter |
| **Book metadata** | Reading status, rating, collections, summary note, custom title/author, handmade TOC | Per-field last-write-wins; status uses the lifecycle lattice | Master toggle + per-field sub-toggles |
| **Render settings** | Font face, font size, line spacing, font weight, page margins | Per-field last-write-wins | Master toggle (off by default) + per-field sub-toggles |
| **KOReader plugin databases** | Syncery does **not** carry these DBs. It periodically triggers KOReader's **Reading Statistics** and **Vocabulary Builder** to run their **own** cloud-storage sync, so your stats and word lists stay in sync just like your position and annotations. | N/A (Syncery only triggers; the plugins' cloud merge handles conflicts) | Master toggle (Statistics & Vocabulary) + sub-toggles per plugin + interval (1–1440 min) + unified server opt-in |
### Statistics & Vocabulary sync

Syncery can periodically trigger KOReader's native **Reading Statistics** and **Vocabulary Builder** to sync their own databases over the cloud.

Syncery does **not** carry, read, or merge these SQLite databases. Instead, it fires each plugin's existing Cloud storage+ sync on a repeating timer — the same mechanism they use when you tap "Sync now" in their own menus. Each plugin performs its own three-way merge, so concurrent edits across devices are reconciled, not overwritten.

**Requirements:**
- Cloud storage+ plugin enabled (or the built-in SyncService)
- Each plugin needs a cloud server configured in its own settings (Dropbox or WebDAV — FTP does not work)
- Syncthing does not carry these plugins' databases; cloud storage only

**What you configure under *Sync Vocab & Statistics*:**
- **Master toggle** — on/off (off by default)
- **Statistics** / **Vocabulary** sub-toggles — which plugin to trigger
- **Interval** — how often (1–1440 min, default 5)
- **Use Syncery's cloud server** — writes Syncery's server address into each plugin's settings so you configure the destination once instead of in each plugin separately

**Page-turn behaviour:** the actual sync runs synchronously on KOReader's UI thread, so a page turn during sync may lag briefly.

## Transports

Syncery writes plain-JSON files; a transport replicates them. Two are supported: **Syncthing** (peer-to-peer) and **Cloud** (Dropbox/WebDAV/FTP via KOReader's Cloud storage+ or Cloud storage, immediately consistent). Both implement the same contract — `id`, `push`, `status` — so the orchestrator drives them identically.

<details>
<summary><b>Per-transport detail + comparison</b></summary>

### Syncthing

Peer-to-peer encrypted file replication via the Syncthing REST API. Configured
under **Transports → Configure Syncthing…**:

- **API key** — *Set up API key…* stores the Syncthing REST API key. Not needed
  when KOSyncthing+ is detected (it supplies the key).
- **Folder** — *Choose Syncthing folder* asks the daemon for its folder list and
  lets you pick one. That folder is the scan root for book discovery and
  `.stignore` placement.
- **Host** — fixed to `127.0.0.1`: the daemon runs locally, watching the files
  Syncery writes. *Advanced* exposes only the port, for non-standard setups.
- **Test connection** — pings the daemon and validates the API key.
- **KOSyncthing+** — when installed, it is auto-detected for URL + API key +
  folder discovery.
- **`.stignore` suppression** — `*syncery-*sync-conflict-*` is written into
  `.stignore` at the folder root. Non-blocking, idempotent, merge-safe, and
  works even when the daemon is down.
- **Eventually consistent** — push is fire-and-forget; the daemon replicates
  asynchronously.

### Cloud

Uses KOReader's Cloud storage+ plugin or if unavailable Cloud storage.
Configured under **Transports → Cloud settings**:

- **Destination** — pick or change where Syncery uploads its JSON files
  (Dropbox/WebDAV/FTP, via the chosen backend).
- **Clear destination** — forget the saved destination on this device only; no
  cloud files are deleted.
- **Check cloud settings** — confirms a destination is set. Reachability is
  verified on the next sync.
- **Debounce window** — how long to wait after a save before uploading.
- **Immediately consistent** — upload returns a real HTTP response code.
- **Staging + upload** — writes to a staging directory; the backend uploads
  asynchronously, with quiet toast suppression during background sync.

### Common interface

| Aspect | Syncthing | Cloud |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Backend** | Syncthing daemon (local) | KOReader SyncService / Cloud storage+ |
| **Transport** | REST API (HTTP/HTTPS) | Provider-specific (WebDAV, FTP, Dropbox API) |
| **Consistency** | Eventual (push fire-and-forget) | Immediate (HTTP response) |
| **Folder / destination** | Pick from the live folder list | Pick the destination via the backend |
| **Conflict copies** | Possible (`.sync-conflict-*`) | Never (request-response) |
| **Auth** | API key (manual / KOSyncthing+ / config.xml) | Backend credentials |
| **.stignore** | `*syncery-*sync-conflict-*` managed | N/A |
| **Scan trigger** | REST scan after push | N/A (upload only) |
| **Retry** | Via Policy (transient errors) | Via Policy (transient errors) |
| **Test** | Ping the daemon | Destination check (reachability on next sync) |

</details>

## Conflict resolution

Every save reads three views — local, the shared remote, and the per-device ancestor — and merges them:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SAVE[Save event] --> READ[Read local · remote · ancestor]
    READ --> MERGE{3-way merge}
    MERGE -->|local = remote| SKIP[Skip — nothing changed]
    MERGE -->|one side changed| ADOPT[Adopt changed side]
    MERGE -->|both changed, same field| CONFLICT[Conflict record]
    CONFLICT --> PERSIST[Save to shared + journal]
    ADOPT --> PERSIST
    PERSIST --> PUSH[Push via transport]
    PUSH --> DONE([Done])
```

Reading status is the one field that can *genuinely* conflict. KOReader stores it as `new` / `reading` / `complete` / `abandoned` — the last two appear in the UI as **Finished** and **On hold**. Because `complete` (Finished) and `abandoned` (On hold) are incomparable, status resolves through a small lattice rather than a timestamp:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    new --> reading
    reading --> complete
    reading --> abandoned
    note right of complete
        complete and abandoned
        are incomparable —
        never silently merge
    end note
```

<details>
<summary><b>Per-category detail</b></summary>

### Annotations: 3-way merge

Three views are compared on every sync:

1. **Local** — what's on this device right now
2. **Remote** — what's in the shared JSON file
3. **Ancestor** — the last-sync file recorded per-device

The 3-way merge (Git-style, in `merge.lua`) distinguishes:
- **In last-sync + NOT in local** → the user deleted it. Keep it deleted.
- **NOT in last-sync + NOT in local** → new from remote. Adopt it.
- **Same field changed on both sides** → a conflict record. Data preserved,
  not lost.

### Reading progress: last-write-wins

Each entry carries `(revision, timestamp)`. Highest revision wins;
the timestamp breaks ties. No entry is ever structurally deleted.

### Reading status: lifecycle lattice

The status lattice (`status_lattice.lua`) handles the special case:
- `new < reading < complete` (forward, automatic)
- `new < reading < abandoned` (forward, automatic)
- `complete ⟂ abandoned` (incomparable — resolved by the generation counter)

### Conflict-copy files

When Syncthing creates `*syncery-*sync-conflict-*` files:

1. `.stignore` prevents replication to other devices.
2. The conflict resolver (2-way merge: `(revision, timestamp)` wins for
   progress; per-entry newer-wins for annotations) merges the content and
   deletes the copy.
3. KOSyncthing+ hides them from its conflict badge.

The Cloud transport does not produce conflict copies (request-response).

## Lifecycle events

KOReader's lifecycle events (close, suspend, resume, power-off, quit, settings flush) are routed to a central teardown with the right "how hard to flush" opts — strongest on quit and close (which also shut the transport down), flush-only on suspend and power-off. Stale timers are guarded by a `destroyed` flag.

<details>
<summary><b>Event-to-handler table</b></summary>

| KOReader event | Lifecycle handler | Teardown opts | What happens |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `onCloseDocument` | `on_close_document()` | `{ destroying = true }` | Full destroying flush: persist progress + annotations + opportunistic cloud push + deferred scan; transport shut down |
| `onSuspend` | `on_suspend()` | `{}` | Flush only — no teardown |
| `onResume` | `on_resume()` | (none) | Bounded connectivity poll, then a checkRemote re-check on wake |
| `onPowerOff` | `on_power_off()` | `{}` | Flush only (non-destroying — the plugin survives, the transport stays up) |
| `onQuit` | `on_quit()` | `{ destroying = true }` | Strongest: full destroying flush + transport shutdown, at process scope |
| `onFlushSettings` | `on_flush_settings()` | (none) | Debounce-triggers a Syncthing scan when a document is open |
| `onSaveSettings` | `on_save_settings()` | (none) | Persists Syncery state alongside KOReader's settings flush |
| `onPageUpdate` / `onPosUpdate` | `schedule_auto_save()` | (none) | Arms the autosave timer |

All lifecycle callbacks check a `destroyed` flag before executing, so stale
timers from a closed document never fire.

The jump thresholds (`percent_epsilon`, `sync_trigger_delta`) are internal
`jump_policy` constants, not persisted settings. A few additional internal keys
exist (e.g. journal/activity-log caps). Transport configuration lives in
`G_reader_settings` — plugin updates never touch your credentials or pairing
data. Syncery's device identity is KOReader's own `device_id` (a stable UUID it
generates once at startup and also uses to stamp native annotations);
`syncery_device_id` is only a fallback for environments where that is unset.

## Architecture overview

The plugin is organised into independent engines (`syncery_ann/`, `syncery_progress/`), a transport layer (`syncery_transports/` with `syncthing/` and `cloud/` providers), lifecycle and timers (`syncery_lifecycle/`), the UI (`syncery_ui/`), and storage-mode migration (`syncery_migration/`). Pure logic (merge, policy, identity, lattice) is kept separate from I/O so it can be unit-tested.

## Troubleshooting

Common problems and how to fix them:

<details>
<summary><b>Common problems and solutions</b></summary>

### Smart header shows "⚠ Transport unavailable"

One or more transports are enabled but their backends are not reachable.

- **Syncthing**: Is the daemon running? Check `http://127.0.0.1:8384`.
  If using KOSyncthing+, open its menu to verify daemon status.
  Tap the header → opens the failing transport's setup.
- **Cloud**: Is KOReader's SyncService or Cloud storage+ configured with a
  working destination? Check with **Transports → Cloud settings → Check cloud
  settings**.

### Smart header shows "⚠ Syncthing not configured"

Syncthing is enabled but has no API key or folder:

- Open **Transports → Configure Syncthing…**, set the API key, pick a folder.
- Or install KOSyncthing+ for auto-discovery.

### Sync data not appearing on another device

- **Syncthing**: Eventually consistent. Push is fire-and-forget; the daemon
  replicates asynchronously. Wait a few seconds, trigger a rescan on the
  receiving device. Check the Syncthing log for folder errors.
- **Cloud**: Request-response. If upload returned 200/201, the file is on
  the server. Check the receiving device's Cloud status.
- **Debounce**: Syncery debounces pushes per-transport per-book. Rapid saves
  within the window are skipped.

### "Jump to position" not showing

- Jump mode is `"never"` — change it under **What's synced → (on this device)
  → Jump → Ask first**.
- No remote data yet — the other device hasn't synced this book.
- The percent difference is below the threshold.
- It's too soon since the last local write.

### Trash Bin shows no deleted annotations

- Deleted annotations become tombstones. Delete some via **This book → Delete
  annotations only (keeps progress)** or **Full reset**, then browse the Trash
  Bin (under *What's synced*).
- The Trash Bin is per-book (open the book, then open the Trash Bin).

### Sync journal shows unexpected entries

- Every annotation-merge event is recorded. "skip" means the merge was
  debounced (no change). "conflict_absorbed" means a conflict file was merged
  and cleaned. "failed" means something went wrong — check the transport's
  maintenance under **Tools → Syncthing** / **Tools → Cloud**.

### "Storage mode switched — files not found"

- Re-open **Advanced → Storage mode** and confirm. Migration is idempotent.
- Run **Tools → Remove orphaned sync files…** to find stray files.

### Conflict copies accumulating

- Check that `.stignore` contains `*syncery-*sync-conflict-*`. A sync run
  rewrites it.
- If using KOSyncthing+, verify its integration status under **Tools →
  Syncthing → KOSyncthing+ integration status…**.
- The Cloud transport does not produce conflict copies.

### Plugin not in Tools menu

- Restart KOReader (plugins load at startup).
- Verify the folder is named exactly `syncery.koplugin/` in the right
  `plugins/` directory.
- Check KOReader's `crash.log` for Syncery errors.

## Acknowledgements

The **Annotation Browser** is inspired by [xblain/annotationsviewer.koplugin](https://github.com/xblain/annotationsviewer.koplugin) — the idea of browsing annotations across all books in a single view was pioneered there. Syncery's version extends that concept to show annotations from every device side by side.
