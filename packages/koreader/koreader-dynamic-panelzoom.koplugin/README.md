## Features
- **🤖 Real-time Detection:** Analyzes pages instantly using KOReader's native engine.
- **📖 Focused View:** Centers each panel and masks adjacent content to reduce distractions.
- **⚡ Smart Pre-loading:** Renders the next panel in the background for zero-lag transitions.
- **🔄 Reading Direction:** Supports Left-to-Right (Western) and Right-to-Left (Manga).
- **🔍 Hold-to-Zoom Mode:** Long-press on any panel to instantly enter a free-zoom state with smart text padding to read cut-off speech bubbles or admire wide landscape art.

## Installation
1. Download the latest `dynamic_panelzoom.koplugin.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/JorgeTheFox/koreader-dynamic-panelzoom/releases).
2. Unzip and copy the `dynamic_panelzoom.koplugin` folder to your KOReader's `plugins/` directory.
3. Restart KOReader.

## Usage
1. Open a comic (`.cbz`, `.pdf`, etc.) in "full page mode": fit = full and view mode = page (see the gif above).
2. Go to the top menu, tap on the document tab and check **Allow panel zoom**.
3. Select **Reading direction**:
   - **Left-to-Right (LTR)** for Western comics
   - **Right-to-Left (RTL)** for Manga/Eastern comics
4. **Standard panel settings** (Optional):
   - **Show adjacent page content:** Toggle whether parts of the page outside the current panel are masked or visible.
   - **Padding around panel:** Adds a margin (`0%` to `10%`) around the detected panel for the standard panel view.
5. **Hold-to-Zoom settings** (Optional):
   - **Hold-to-Zoom padding:** Adds a safe margin (`2%` to `20%`) around the detected panel to capture overlapping speech bubbles when long-pressing.
   - **Initial zoom level:** Choose how the zoom mode starts (`1.0x Fit` to `2.0x Heavy Zoom`).
6. **Navigation:**
   - Long-press on a panel to enable panel view.
   - Tap the **edges** of the screen to move between panels or pages.
   - **Hold (Long-press)** anywhere while viewing a panel to trigger the **Free Zoom Mode**.
   - Tap the **center** to exit panel view.

## Known Issues
- **Full page mode Only:** If you use the plugin without full page view, you may see some repeated panels.

- *Tested primarily on Linux (Native/AppImage) and Kindle Colorsoft (2025).*
