## Databases

Cozy Home uses two SQLite databases:

| Database | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `cozyhome.db` | Learning spaces, focus mode data, preferences |
| `cozy_flashcards.db` | Flashcards, decks, review history, daily stats |

The flashcard database is shared with Cozy Flashcards if both plugins are
installed. Cozy Home can create and manage it independently.
